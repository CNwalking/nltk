"Attorney General Loretta Lynch defended the government's demand that Apple assist the FBI in its attempt to unlock the phone of one of the San Bernardino terrorists, telling a House panel Wednesday the pending legal battle has clarified how encryption represents \"a very real threat to law enforcement's mission.\"
Lynch, in her first public remarks on the matter since a federal magistrate last week ordered the tech giant to cooperate with authorities, did not mention Apple by name but indicated that judges have authority to direct \"third parties\" to assist the government in a search for evidence in criminal investigations.
Federal authorities have been attempting to determine whether a cellphone used by Syed Farook, one of the shooters in December's San Bernardino, Calif., mass shooting that left 14 dead, contains additional information that could clarify the motive for the attack and resolve questions about whether Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, were aided by others unknown to authorities. Investigators have been unable to gain access to the contents of the phone since its recovery more than two months ago.
\"We owe it to the victims to ensure we have done everything under the law to fully investigate,\" Lynch said.
