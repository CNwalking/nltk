"An American service member was killed Tuesday in Afghanistan, the first combat fatality there since January, the military announced.
The attack on a patrol with a roadside bomb occurred in Helmand province, where Taliban forces have gained ground against Afghan government security forces.
The U.S.-led NATO coalition bolstering Afghan troops has scrambled in recent days to keep from losing Helmand province, the restive area home to many Taliban members.
Another U.S. service member and six Afghan troops were wounded in the attack.
About 100 U.S. troops were sent there Monday to train and advise Afghan forces struggling to control the provincial capital of Lashkar Gah.
Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook said Monday that Gen. John Nicholson, the top commander in Afghanistan, sent U.S. troops to Helmand province on a temporary basis.
\"Part of that effort will be again to reinforce them in areas, particularly in Afghanistan, where they have seen some setbacks, and Helmand's one of them,\" Cook said.
Defense Secretary Ash Carter said in a statement that the fatality shows how dangerous Afghanistan continues to be.
\"I was deeply saddened to learn one of our service members was killed today and another wounded while engaged in our mission to train, advise and assist Afghan forces,\" Carter said. \"We will continue to work closely with the government of Afghanistan and our NATO partners to bolster the capabilities of the (Afghan military), so they can provide the people of Afghanistan the peace they deserve.\"
Tuesday's attack remains under investigation, according to the military command in Afghanistan.
\"On behalf of all of U.S. forces -- Afghanistan, as well as Resolute Support -- our deepest sympathies go out to the families and friends of those involved,\" Nicholson said in a statement.
