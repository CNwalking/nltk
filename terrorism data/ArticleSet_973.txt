"A Colombian man who had a role in what prosecutors said were efforts to transport drugs and help a terror group obtain weapons to build a dirty bomb to attack Americans was sentenced on Monday to 13 years in prison.
The man, Jhon Jairo Cruz Trejos, was sentenced in federal court in Manhattan by Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald, who said he deserved more than the mandatory minimum of 10 years in prison because the allegations were more serious than a typical international drug deal.
An assistant United States attorney, Emil J. Bove III, said Mr. Cruz Trejos, 44, was ready to assist in \"attacks of the greatest order.\" In court papers, prosecutors described him as a freelance weapons trafficker, saying he sought in 2010 and 2011 to obtain enriched uranium so a terrorism group based in South America could build a dirty bomb. The government said the group wanted to attack United States military personnel or the United States Embassy in Colombia.
Mr. Cruz Trejos said that he was not anti-American and that talk of weaponry was bluster. \"I would like to express to you how deeply sorry I am for having agreed to participate,\" he said. \"Your Honor, my conduct was wrong.\"
He said he was trying to arrange a drug deal to raise financing for a municipal business he was starting.
