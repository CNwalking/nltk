"Nigerian separatists have hijacked a merchant ship and threatened to blow it up with its foreign crew if the authorities do not release a separatist leader seeking the independence of Biafra, a region in southeastern Nigeria, military officers have said. Maj. Gen. Rabe Abubakar, the Defense Ministry spokesman, on Monday confirmed that the hijacking had occurred on Friday and called it \"an act of sabotage.\" Other officers on Tuesday said that the hijackers had given the government 31 days to free the separatist, Nnamdi Kanu, director of the banned Radio Biafra. Mr. Kanu was detained in October and has been accused of terrorist activities. Maritime industry reports indicated that the vessel, an oil tanker, was seized off Nigeria's southeastern Atlantic Ocean coast. In the 1960s, Nigeria's Igbo people waged a civil war to make Biafra a separate state.
