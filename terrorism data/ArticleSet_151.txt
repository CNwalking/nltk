"Singapore on Wednesday said that it had arrested and deported 26 Bangladeshi construction workers for forming a religious study group that spread the ideology of Al Qaeda and the Islamic State group. The workers were arrested in November and detained without trial under the Internal Security Act, the Ministry of Home Affairs said. It said the workers held weekly meetings to share jihadist-related materials and discuss armed conflicts involving Muslims. The Bangladeshis were not planning attacks in Singapore, but several of them had considered carrying out attacks overseas, the ministry said.
