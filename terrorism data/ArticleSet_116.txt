"The police said Thursday that they had shot and killed two members of a banned Islamist group blamed for a spate of recent attacks. The police have stepped up their hunt for Islamist militants after a wave of violence that included attacks on mosques, Christian priests and Hindu temples. Two members of the banned group, Jamaat-ul-Mujahedeen, were killed in an exchange of gunfire after the police raided their hide-out on the outskirts of the capital, Dhaka, after midnight, said Sanwar Hossain, a deputy commissioner of the police in the detective branch. The group is believed to be behind several recent attacks, including the bombing of a Shiite shrine and the shooting of three foreigners, two of whom died. The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for some of the attacks, including the killing of a Christian convert last week.
