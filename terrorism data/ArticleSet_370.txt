"The U.S.-led coalition has ramped up its air campaign on the Islamic State's finances, launching 15 strikes against cash depots and more than 125 attacks on oil infrastructure over the past six months, according to U.S. military statistics.
\"We've been able to identify and strike strategic targets that place increased pressure on their ability to recruit and sustain operations,\" Air Force Lt. Gen. Charles Brown, who oversees the air war, said in a statement.
The Islamic State cut pay to its fighters by as much as half after much of the terror group's cash literally went up in smoke, according to the Pentagon. Revenue from oil, the principal source of income, also has taken a hit.
\"Targeting an enemy's economy is almost as old as air power,\" said Richard Muller, a military history professor at the Air Force's School of Advanced Air and Space studies at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Ala.
The coalition launched Operation Tidal Wave II last year, an air campaign targeting the Islamic State's oil refineries, collection points and other facilities.
In the current campaign, military planners are making a similar effort to get at the oil revenue that keeps the Islamic State afloat.
