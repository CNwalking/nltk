"The Islamic State claimed responsibility for an attack in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta on Thursday that left seven dead including five attackers.
At least three bombs exploded near a Starbucks cafe in downtown Jakarta, and gunmen attacked a police post and other locations, authorities said. Analysts said the attack was the work of a sophisticated terrorist cell operating in the country.
The attackers sought to mimic the Paris attacks on Nov. 13 that killed 130 people, police said. Thursday's assaults took place in a busy shopping area close to many embassies and a United Nations office. The Islamic State, which grew out of al-Qaeda in Iraq and controls large swaths of territory in that country and neighboring Syria, has now launched attacks in 15 countries on five continents.
Indonesia's coordinating minister for politics, legal and security affairs, Luhut Binsar Panjaitan, told journalists after reviewing the blast scene that fast-acting police prevented further carnage.
\"This is suicide bombing, one was entering Starbucks and then three others tried to attack with thrown bombs. Those (attackers) were shot\" by police, Panjaitan said.
\"They imitated the terror actions in Paris,\" said national police spokesman Anton Charliyan.
