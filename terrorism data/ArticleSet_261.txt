"At least 50 people were killed Sunday in a triple suicide bombing near the Syrian capital of Damascus as a United Nations special envoy launched indirect peace talks to end the country's civil war.
The bombing, which the Islamic State claimed it orchestrated, underscored the difficulty of finding a political solution to the war nearing its fifth anniversary.
Attackers detonated a car bomb at a bus stop, and two suicide bombers set off more explosives as rescuers rushed to the area, according to Syria's state news agency SANA. The blasts went off in the Damascus suburb of Sayyda Zeinab, about 600 yards from one of the holiest shrines for Shiite Muslims.
The Syrian Foreign Ministry said more than 100 people were wounded in addition to the 50 killed. State TV footage showed damage that included several burning cars and a torched bus, plus blown-out windows and large holes in the facade of a nearby apartment tower, the Associated Press reported.
A website affiliated with the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIS, said the attacks were carried out by members of the extremist group, which controls large areas in Syria and Iraq.
The U.N.-hosted peace talks in Geneva got off to a rocky start Friday when Staffan de Mistura, a U.N. special envoy for the Syria crisis, met only with a Syrian government delegation amid disagreement over which rebel groups should be allowed to negotiate. Opposition leaders refused to take part unless a siege of rebel-held areas was lifted, and Russian and Syrian bombardment of fighters stopped.
De Mistura paid an informal visit Sunday to the main opposition group -- the Saudi-backed Higher Negotiations Committee -- and said he is \"optimistic and determined\" about the talks, the AP said.
In Washington, Secretary of State John Kerry urged both sides to work toward a cease-fire.
