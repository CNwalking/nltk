"HARTFORD -- A Connecticut man who fired a rifle at a mosque next to his home after the Paris terrorist attacks last year is expected to plead guilty to a federal hate crime.
A lawyer for the man, Ted Hakey Jr., said his client would plead guilty on Thursday in a federal court in Hartford to damaging religious property.
The authorities said Mr. Hakey shot at Baitul Aman Mosque in Meriden, a city about halfway between Harford and New Haven, shortly after the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris that killed 130 people. The mosque was empty, and no one was hurt when four bullets struck it.
Mr. Hakey is free on $400,000 bail. His lawyers disputed arguments by the prosecutors that Mr. Hakey was too dangerous to be released on bail. A sentencing date has not been set. Mr. Hakey could face up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
