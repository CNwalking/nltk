"Irish nationalists opposed to Northern Ireland's peace process have told the BBC they were behind a fatal shooting on Friday at a boxing weigh-in at a Dublin hotel, saying it was retaliation for the killing of an ally in 2012. One man was killed and two others wounded when gunmen dressed like special forces operatives opened fire with automatic weapons, an attack that shocked the country weeks before a Feb. 26 parliamentary election. A spokesman for Ireland's police said it was investigating the shooting and could not confirm if the two were linked. In a statement to the BBC in which an agreed code word was used, a man claiming to speak for the leadership of the dissident group Continuity I.R.A. said its members were responsible, saying it was retaliation for the fatal shooting in September 2012 of Alan Ryan, another militant nationalist.
