"Senegal said Tuesday that the police had questioned about 900 people over the past few days as part of a heightened security operation after terrorist attacks in Burkina Faso and Mali. Soro Diop, a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice, said the operation was a response to the growing threat of extremism in the region, not a specific threat. About 520 people among those questioned were arrested on charges related to drugs, counterfeit currency and missing documents. Despite Senegal's reputation as a peaceful country, Mr. Diop warned that the nation's residents must stay vigilant.
