"KABUL, Afghanistan -- A Taliban suicide bomber killed at least three people on Monday and wounded 18 more in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif, officials said.
The bomber, who was on foot, detonated his explosives near a minibus carrying Afghan National Army troops and security employees.
Mazar-i-Sharif, the capital of Balkh Province and a major commercial center, had until recently seemed almost immune to the violence regularly rocking much of the rest of Afghanistan. But the security situation there has been gradually deteriorating since the withdrawal of United States combat soldiers at the end of 2014, representing a worrying extension of the conflict into an important economic center and gateway to Tajikistan, the source of much of the country's energy.
In a separate attack on Monday, in southeastern Paktika Province, a suicide bomber set off his explosives outside a bakery in the Yahya Khail district, killing at least six civilians and wounding nine more, including three children. The district governor, Musa Khan Kharuti, said that the motive of the attack was unknown, but that it appeared the attacker might have detonated his bomb by accident. No one claimed responsibility for that attack.
