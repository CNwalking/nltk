"Two 25-year-old men were convicted Tuesday of trying to become fighters for the Islamic State. Nader Elhuzayel and Muhanad Badawi, both of Anaheim, Calif., schemed last year for Mr. Elhuzayel to fly to the Middle East to fight for the Islamic State, federal officials said. Mr. Badawi, a college engineering student, also was convicted of aiding and abetting an attempt to provide support for terrorists and financial aid fraud. Authorities say he used a federal college grant to support the cause. Mr. Elhuzayel also was convicted of 26 counts of bank fraud. Federal officials said he deposited stolen checks in his bank accounts and withdrew money, intending to use the cash to fight in Syria. The F.B.I. said the men shared their support for the Islamic State in conversation and on social media. Their lawyers say their comments were offensive but not criminal. Mr. Badawi's lawyer said he never actually intended to fight for the Islamic State but \"was a lot of talk and absolutely no action.\" (AP)
