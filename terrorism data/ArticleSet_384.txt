"Islamic State militants killed a Navy SEAL in northern Iraq on Tuesday after they penetrated Kurdish defensive lines and launched an attack with small arms and car bombs.
The SEAL was Charles Keating IV, grandson of the Phoenix savings-and-loan financier with the same name, Bradley Boland, Keating's uncle, confirmed to The Arizona Republic.
It was the third American combat death in Iraq since the U.S. military deployed advisers and other personnel there in 2014 to support the war against the Islamic State.
\"He had a calling, a sense of duty, to serve his country,\" Liz Keating, 32, of Cincinnati said of her cousin, an acclaimed distance runner. \"He just had this sense of purpose for what he was doing. He loved what he was doing. He was a real-life superhero.\"
White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Islamic State terrorists overran Iraqi soldiers guarding a checkpoint and then attacked Kurdish peshmerga fighters 2 miles away, where the U.S. servicemember was advising.
