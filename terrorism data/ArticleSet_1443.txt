"\"Come From Away,\" a small and unusual Canadian musical about a remote community's heartwarming response to Sept. 11, will make its Broadway bow in February.
The show is based on events in Gander, Newfoundland, when 38 planes carrying 6,579 people were forced to land there because of the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. The musical explores the response of Gander residents, and their developing relationships with the deeply unsettled passengers.
The long-gestating show has had several productions, and won critical praise last year at the La Jolla Playhouse and Seattle Repertory Theater. It has been revised along the way, and is scheduled to play later this year at Ford's Theater in Washington and at the Royal Alexandra Theater in Toronto.
The show is written by a Toronto couple, Irene Sankoff and David Hein, who are making their Broadway debut. The director is Christopher Ashley (\"Memphis\"), and the ensemble cast of 12 includes Chad Kimball (\"Memphis\") and Jenn Colella (\"If/Then\"). The producers, Junkyard Dog Productions, said they have been promised a Shubert theater, but did not specify which one.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
