"Federal prosecutors announced on Wednesday that they had charged a sixth man in connection with an alleged terrorist network based in Brooklyn, which has been accused of providing material support to the Islamic State.
The new defendant, Azizjon Rakhmatov, 28, was secretly added on Monday to a pre-existing indictment of four other men -- Akhror Saidakhmetov, Abror Habibov, Dilkhayot Kasimov and Akmal Zakirov -- who were accused of similar crimes in February 2015. Another defendant, Abdurasul Hasanovich Juraboev, pleaded guilty in the case in August.
In announcing the new charges, the prosecutors said that Mr. Rakhmatov, whose nationality is Uzbek, worked with Mr. Habibov and Mr. Zakirov to help fund Mr. Saidakhmetov's efforts to travel to Syria and fight with the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. Mr. Saidakhmetov, 19 at the time of his arrest, was taken into custody on a jetway at Kennedy International Airport last year as he boarded a flight to Istanbul.
In the eight days before Mr. Saidakhmetov left, Mr. Rakhmatov and others transferred about $2,400 into Mr. Zakirov's personal bank account -- money that was intended to pay for the trip and to help Mr. Saidakhmetov buy a weapon, court papers say. Prosecutors say that Mr. Saidakhmetov and Mr. Juraboev had spoken about planting a bomb in Coney Island and attacking President Obama on behalf of ISIS, though the authorities have not presented evidence that the men took steps beyond mere talk of these events.
Mr. Rakhmatov was charged after the federal agents captured him discussing the plot with Mr. Habibov in numerous electronic intercepts. He remained in custody on Wednesday and would face a maximum sentence of 50 years in prison, if convicted.
