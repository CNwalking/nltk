"Sally Letts says 20-year-old son is in Syria to do humanitarian work, not as terrorist fighting with Islamic State
The mother of a young man reported to be the first white Briton to join Islamic State has said it is ridiculous to suggest her son is a terrorist.
Sally Letts said her son Jack, 20, from Oxford, was not a member of the Islamist organisation and had gone to Syria to do humanitarian work.
In an interview with the Guardian, she confirmed her son had been in Raqqa, the headquarters of Isis, but said newspaper reports that he had married, had a baby boy and was going by the name Ibrahim or Abu Mohammed were all false. Since the allegations appeared in the media, Jack Letts has posted denials on his Facebook page.
His father, John, said newspapers made up the nickname \"Jihadi Jack\" because it suited their agenda. \"It's so ridiculous,\" he said. \"It was made up. Everything is alleged.
\"People hear what they want to hear. They can't resist the alliteration of Jihadi John and Jihadi Jack,\" he added, in reference to the Isis terrorist Mohammed Emwazi, who was killed by a drone attack in November.
It was reported at the weekend that Jack Letts, who converted to Islam while living in the UK, was one of 750 Britons to have joined Isis. The Mail Online said he was \"a frontline fighter for the brutal terror group and lives with his Iraqi wife and his son Muhammed after moving to the Iraqi city of Fallujah from Raqqa\".
However, his mother said: \"We spoke to him yesterday and he said he had never had a weapon in his life.
\"Jack never had a weapon, never posed in a photo with a weapon, but every article mentions it,\" said his father. \"I bought him those cargo trousers from a sports shop in Oxford,\" he added, referring to the photo featured in the press over the past two days. \"It's all insinuation, [people] forcing connections that don't exist.\"
Jack Letts denied he had a wife and son or was fighting for Isis in a mocking Facebook update. He also alleged that some acquaintances had access to his social media, and were to blame for posting extremist messages under his name.
\"It's sort-of awkward when the media thinks your Isis and your not,\" he wrote. \"Thinks you have a son and you dont. Thinks your married when your not. Mabye they got bored worrying about what colour socks certain celebrities wear and took out the frustration on me?
\"The formula with the media is simple: English guy became muslim + went to the middle east + followed islam = Isis + eats babies x evil.
\"It doesnt help, admittedly, that bare different people have used my fb [Facebook] account (some of whom are extreme etc..and only got my password through one guy I stupidly trusted).\"
His parents backed up his claim that his Facebook account had been used by others.
\"Jack himself said that he stupidly let someone else, who was an extremist, use his account, so we can't say that any posts sent from his account are definitely from him,\" his mother said. \"Also, we have suspected before that posts supposedly sent from him weren't actually from him because of the strange content, or the spelling, sentence structure, some sentences appeared as if they were translated from another language.\"
His mother, an administrator, said the family were worried sick about his welfare because he was in a conflict zone. \"He is in danger every single moment of the day,\" she said.
His father said, however, that there was no evidence he had been near a battle zone.
They said their son, a former student of Cherwell academy school, Oxford, was attracted to Syria because he wanted to help innocent people and save lives. \"For a year and a half he saw outrageous horrors of everyday life. He had a strong humanitarian conviction.\"
Asked if they thought their son was foolish given the fate of the British taxi driver, Alan Henning, who was beheaded after going to Syria with aid, his father said his son was different because he \"is integrated in day-to-day life with Syrian people\".
They said they were in touch with their son once a month but did not know his precise whereabouts.
\"We know he spent time in Raqqa, but we are not entirely sure where he is now. He said he had worked in a hospital. He is not a fighter,\" said his mother. \"People who are living in [Isis] territory doesn't necessarily mean they are [Isis] fighters.\"
They said their son was determined to help, so they discussed his options before he left. \"When he became Muslim I said if you're going to help people, you'll be a liability except if you speak the language -- you'll just be another mouth to feed -- then you can help on refugee camps.
\"He dropped out of school and taught himself Arabic on his own because he wanted to be useful; said he wanted to help medical staff but had no medical skills,\" Sally Letts said.
John Letts, an organic farmer, said his son told him that his duty was to be the best Muslim he could be. \"He wanted to do the right thing as a Muslim and said if he can prevent the death of another person it was saving the whole of humanity.\"
They confirmed that the family home had been raided by police twice and had laptops and mobile phones confiscated, but said the police had \"no evidence he had done anything wrong\".
John Letts said: \"It's like he's walking on a train track with a blindfold, with a train [coming down the tracks]. Blindfolded in the sense he can't see the danger ahead of him but determined to help people.\"
When he left Britain in 2014, Jack told his parents he was going to Kuwait to study Arabic but later told them he had gone to Syria. \"We were in utter shock. We have been trying to convince him to come back,\" his mother said.
His father said they were terrified of what might happen now. \"The allegations become fact and the facts become embellished and then the embellishments become completely exaggerated and out of context, to the extent he has now become a girl in some articles.
\"If the ramifications were not so serious, it could be a comedy.\"
In his Facebook posting, Letts also mocked some of the news reports about him.
\"One of the funniest articles was the one were the last sentence was 'Jack Letts and Isis have been contacted for comment. Like me and Isis have like a shared office in which we recieve requests for comment and were still thinking about whether to reply or not.\"
