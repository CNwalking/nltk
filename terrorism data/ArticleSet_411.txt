"The Taliban has had a quick succession of leaders recently. A look at who has led:
1 Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada
The Taliban announced that the former leader of the organization's court system, Haibatullah Akhundzada would take over following Mansoor's death. Akhundzada is a hawkish religious cleric and scholar. He is believed to be in his mid-50s.
2 Mullah Akhtar Mansoor
Akhtar Mansoor effectively led the group after Omar's death. He was formerly installed by an election in 2015. He was believed to be about 48 when he was killed last weekend by a U.S. drone strike in Pakistan.
3 Mullah Mohammed Omar
One-eyed cleric Mohammed Omar gave sanctuary to Osama bin Laden when the al-Qaeda leader planned the 9/11 attacks. He apparently died in 2013 while hiding in Pakistan, but his death was kept hidden by the Taliban for two years until confirmed by Afghanistan's main intelligence agency last July. Omar was believed to have been about 53 when he died. The Afghan government said the cleric died from tuberculosis and other ailments.
