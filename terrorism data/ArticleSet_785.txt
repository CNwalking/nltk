"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- Two Pakistani employees of the United States Consulate in Peshawar were killed Tuesday by a roadside bomb in northwestern Pakistan, officials said.
Jamaat-e-Ahrar, a faction of the Pakistani Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attack, said a spokesman, Ehsanullah Ehsan.
The two employees, Faisal Khan, an anti-narcotics official, and Abid Shah, a driver employed by the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, were killed when the bomb detonated as their convoy was traveling in the Mohmand tribal region. Four other people, including two Pakistani security officials, were wounded. The anti-narcotics team had been reviewing poppy eradication efforts in the area.
\"We extend our condolences and the U.S. government condemns the attack,\" said the United States Embassy public affairs officer, Moulik Berkana. \"We offer our assistance to the government of Pakistan in investigating the incident and bringing perpetrators to justice.\"
