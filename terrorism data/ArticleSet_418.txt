"Iraqi forces halted an assault to free Fallujah from Islamic State control Wednesday for fear of causing the deaths of civilians held hostage in the city, including about 20,000 children.
\"It would be possible to end the battle quickly if protecting civilians wasn't among our priorities,\" Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said on state television. \"Our units are just outside Fallujah -- victory is within our reach.\"
The announcement came two days after government forces entered the southern part of the city.
They met fierce resistance from militants using civilians as \"human shields\" on the front lines and threatening to kill anyone who flees.
The United Nations Children's Fund warned the Iraqi government and Islamic State about an estimated 20,000 children inside the battle zone, saying families should be given safe passage out of the city.
\"As the violence continues to escalate in Fallujah and across Iraq, we are concerned over the protection of children in the face of extreme and rising danger,\" said Peter Hawkins, UNICEF's representative in Iraq.
\"Since the start of the military operation in Fallujah, very few families have been able to leave. Children face the risk of forced recruitment into the fighting, strict procedures for security screening and separation from their families.\"
The United Nations estimates that more than 50,000 people are trapped in Fallujah. For months, the United Nations raised concerns over deteriorating conditions in the city that include shortages of food and medicine.
For more than a week, Iraqi military and Shiite militia forces have been preparing for troops to enter the predominately Sunni city and have surrounded it, while airstrikes have pounded the city, about 35 miles from Baghdad.
