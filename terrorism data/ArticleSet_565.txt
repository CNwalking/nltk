"Several experts, including a former New York City police commissioner, said Sunday the explosion that injured 29 people on a Manhattan street was clearly an act of terrorism, and they were perplexed that Mayor Bill de Blasio called it only \"an intentional act.\"
\"It is absolutely an act of terrorism. I couldn't disagree with him (de Blasio) more,\" Howard Safir, who was police commissioner from 1996 to 2000, said in an interview. \"I think they do a disservice to the public when they try to sugarcoat something that is a horrific act.\"
He said people should realize this is a new era. \"As we are more successful on the battlefields in the Middle East, our adversaries are looking for a target,\" Safir said.
Jerome Hauer, a former commissioner of the New York State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services, said de Blasio might be trying to maintain public calm by not calling the explosion a terrorist attack, \"but it's certainly an act of terrorism.\"
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday there is \"no evidence of an international terrorism connection\" and hedged in characterizing the explosion Saturday night in the Chelsea neighborhood. \"It depends on your definition of terrorism. A bomb exploding in New York is obviously an act of terrorism, but it's not linked to international terrorism. In other words, we find no (Islamic State) connections,\" said Cuomo, a Democrat.
No individual or group publicly claimed credit for the explosion, which occurred around 8:30 p.m. Saturday on a bustling, restaurant-lined street in the largely residential neighborhood. The blast was caused by a homemade device.
Experts said Sunday that the explosion meets the principle federal definition of \"domestic terrorism,\" which was added to federal statutes by the USA Patriot Act shortly after the 9/11 attacks. Federal law defines domestic terrorism as \"acts dangerous to human life\" that appear intended to \"intimidate or coerce a civilian population\" or to influence government policy.
\"It seems to meet the bar of the FBI's definition,\" said Frank Ciluffo, a former special assistant for homeland security to President George W. Bush. Ciluffo directs the Center for Cyber and Homeland Security in Washington. \"We still don't have all the information here and don't know specifically what motivated the individual. But clearly, it was pre-meditated. Clearly, it was targeting innocent civilians.\"
Other parts of federal law define terrorism slightly differently. A \"federal crime of terrorism\" is defined as an offense \"calculated to influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion, or to retaliate against government conduct.\" The definition says nothing about civilians.
In the section of federal law dealing with foreign relations, terrorism is defined as \"premeditated, politically motivated violence\" undertaken by \"subnational groups\" against civilian targets.
Experts said de Blasio, a Democrat, might be refraining from calling the explosion terrorism until authorities know more about the attackers. Motivation is irrelevant to whether an attack involves terrorism, they said.
\"Whether or not it's somebody who's angry at the government or somebody who has come back from Syria or somebody who has been radicalized online, it's still terrorism, and it's going to create this angst in people,\" Hauer said. \"I think the world of Bill de Blasio. But this was clearly terrorism.\"
