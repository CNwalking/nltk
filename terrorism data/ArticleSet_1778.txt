"A previously unreleased video clip brought to light in a news report on Tuesday raised questions about the claim by a former Islamic State member that he had refused to kill while with the group in Syria.
The video clip was published by The Washington Post, which reported that it had come from a current member of the Islamic State in an attempt to discredit the former militant, Harry Sarfo, because of his denunciation of the group. He is in prison in Germany, his home country, serving a reduced sentence because he was cooperating with the authorities in giving information about the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
In the video, Mr. Sarfo can be seen shouting and cheering as he and other militants drive into a Syrian city. Later, he and others can be seen rounding up prisoners, who are forced to lie on the ground. He is standing to the side as the other jihadists open fire. Then Mr. Sarfo appears to cock his handgun and shoot, though the scene is partially blocked.
In interviews with German officials and news organizations, including The New York Times in August, Mr. Sarfo said that he never killed anyone during his time in Syria. That and his cooperation were factors in officials' decision to sentence him to only three years on a terrorism charge after he was arrested while trying to return to Germany in 2015.
German intelligence officials said that Mr. Sarfo's information offered useful insight into the inner workings of ISIS. And his account to The Times about Islamic State procedures and leadership figures correlated with interrogation records and briefings from other former Islamic State members who had been questioned by French, Austrian, German and Belgian officials. Still, some of the details of his account could not be independently confirmed.
