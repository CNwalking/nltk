"At least 12 people were killed Wednesday when explosives carried by at least two women were detonated in a market in the northern town of Chibok, where Boko Haram militants abducted more than 200 girls almost two years ago, the police and residents said. At least 15 people were wounded. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but the attack was similar to others claimed by Boko Haram. It was not immediately clear whether the casualty figures included the bombers. Some analysts say that Boko Haram may be using captives to carry out bombings.
