"The man who the police say planted bombs in New York and New Jersey had a YouTube account that listed his favorite videos, two of which related to jihad, according to a criminal complaint filed in Federal District Court in New York on Tuesday.
The man, Ahmad Khan Rahami, had the account under the user name yaafghankid786, the complaint filed by Peter F. Licata, a special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Joint Terrorism Task Force, said.
One of the videos is labeled \"jihad nasheed ya shahid,\" a reference to a martyr's anthem, the complaint said.
Another video, \"best jihad nasheed,\" is nearly three minutes long and includes subtitles as images of battles on a desert appear.
The subtitles read in part: \"Our sanctuaries would not have been desecrated had the lions surrounded them. The filthiest of bandits have attacked us. So where are the swords? They have forgotten we are defiant ones who defend like lions. We are those who built our forts out of skulls.\"

These battle hymns glorify the violent struggle in religious terms and are meant to instill piety and inspire jihadis.
The 96 videos listed among Mr. Rahami's favorites are ones produced by others and not ones the authorities say that he himself created. Two were set to private and 17 others were deleted. Those that were publicly accessible reflected diverse interests.
Many videos were of love ballads, with depictions of couples in romantic embraces.

Others featured a cat doing back flips on a couch, scary clowns, do-it-yourself instructional videos on tying a Windsor knot on a tie, replacing the bumper on a 2002 or 2003 Acura, configuring the settings on a DVR, and one that featured an episode from the television show \"Judge Judy.\"
