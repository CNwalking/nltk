"Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said Monday the United States strongly supports Iraq's prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, as the Iraqi leader confronts a new round of political turmoil threatening his government.
Protesters in Iraq stormed into the parliament building over the weekend in Baghdad after pulling down barricades around the Green Zone, where much of Iraq's government is housed. \"We support him strongly because of what he stands for,\" Carter said while flying to Germany.
The protesters, mostly followers of renegade Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, left parliament, but the chaos raised concerns about a key U.S. partner in the war against the Islamic State, also called ISIS or ISIL.
\"Prime Minister Abadi has been a partner in all of the things that are important to Iraq's future, namely a country that holds together and doesn't spiral off into sectarianism,\" Carter said.
He praised Norway's announcement to send special operations forces to Jordan to train Syrian Arab forces who are a part of a coalition of local forces battling the Islamic State.
