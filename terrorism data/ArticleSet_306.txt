"An Islamic State operative captured in Iraq told U.S. military personnel that the terrorist group had plans to use mustard gas against American allies fighting them, a senior Defense Department official said Wednesday.
The fighter, who was detained by U.S. special operations forces last month, has been identified by the U.S. military as a chemical weapons specialist, according to the official, who did not want to be named because he is not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The weapons were going to be used against Kurdish forces and other U.S. allies, the official said. The timing of any such attack is unclear.
The captured fighter was the top \"weapons emir\" for the extremist group, according to a second Defense official, who also asked to remain unnamed because of the sensitive nature of the matter. The captive was a top chemical weapons official under Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, ousted during the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 and later executed, the second official said.
The group's chemical arsenal includes chlorine and mustard gas, according to the second official. He added that as a result of intelligence gathered from the captive, the U.S. military destroyed a chemical weapons storage and mixing facility within the past week, and more operations are planned.
The chemical weapons specialist was caught by a special expeditionary force of U.S. commandos sent to Iraq to conduct raids on the Islamic State to capture or kill the group's key leaders and to free hostages. No Americans were injured in the operation, the second official said.
