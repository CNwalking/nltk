"Spanish and Moroccan police officers on Tuesday arrested four people suspected of being members of a cell that sought to recruit fighters for the Islamic State group. Three people were arrested in Spain's North African enclave city of Ceuta, and a Moroccan was arrested in the Moroccan border town of Farkhana, next to Melilla, Spain's other North African enclave, officials said. One of those detained in Ceuta was a former detainee at the American military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, who was not identified by the Spanish authorities. After being captured in 2002 and held in Guantánamo, he was returned to Spain in 2004, said Interior Minister Jorge Fernández Díaz. The suspects had also set up contacts to try to acquire weapons and bomb-making materials and were aiming \"to carry out terrorist acts in Spanish territory,\" Spain's Interior Ministry said.
