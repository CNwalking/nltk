"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg publicly voiced support for Apple in its fight with the FBI over a terrorist's iPhone, rejecting the idea that technology companies should create \"back doors\" for intelligence agencies and law enforcement.
\"We're sympathetic with Apple. We believe in encryption; we think that that's an important tool,\" Zuckerberg said on stage at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.
\"I don't think requiring backdoors with encryption is either going to be an effective way to increase security or is really the right thing to do for just the direction that the world is going to,\" Zuckerberg said.
Zuckerberg also spoke of the \"pretty big responsibility\" Facebook has to \"help prevent terrorism and different kinds of attacks.\"
\"If there is any content that is promoting terrorism or sympathizing with ISIS, we'll take that off the service,\" he said in an interview with journalist Jessi Hempel.
\"We don't want people doing that kind of stuff on Facebook. If we have opportunities to basically work with governments and folks to make sure that there aren't terrorist attacks, then we're going to take those opportunities, and we feel a pretty strong responsibility to help make sure that society is safe,\" Zuckerberg said. \"We care about that. That's a big deal. We take that seriously.\"
A federal judge ordered Apple last week to bypass security functions on the iPhone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, igniting a public fight between the Obama administration and Apple, with the world's most valuable company declaring it would not comply with the order to hack into the phone.
The mass shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., in December left 14 people dead.
