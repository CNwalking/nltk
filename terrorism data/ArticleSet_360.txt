"The Syrian Army claimed victory over the Islamic State in the town of Qaryatain on Sunday, one week after driving the militant group out of historic Palmyra.
The Army Command said retaking Qaryatain was crucial for securing oil and gas pipelines in the area and for blocking militant supply routes between Damascus and Homs, the state-controlled Syrian News Agency reported. The town also gives government forces a foothold for attacking areas along the border with Iraq held by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
Army units \"hunted down fleeing ISIS terrorists inside the city and dismantled scores of explosive devices and mines left behind,\" SANA said.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which supports neither the regime of President Bashar Assad nor the Islamic State, said warplanes were pounding the area and that Islamic State fighters were in retreat.
In Iraq, the military said Sunday it took the northern edge of the Islamic State-held town of Hit, 85 miles west of Baghdad, the Associated Press reported. The operation had been slowed by hundreds of roadside bombs left by the Islamic State, the Iraqi military said.
Qaryatain is a strategic area of fewer than 50,000 people with a strong Christian influence. After taking control of the town last August, the militants posted photos on social media showing bulldozers destroying the Saint Elian Monastery, which dates to the 5th century. Dozens of Christians were abducted by the extremists.
