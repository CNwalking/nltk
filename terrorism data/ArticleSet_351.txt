"Syria's ancient city of Palmyra was recaptured over the weekend from the Islamic State, allowing officials to get a closer look at destruction by the militant group. Palmyra, a UNESCO world heritage site with 2,000-year-old colonnades, once attracted thousands of tourists. Several ancient temples were destroyed along with the prized Arch of Triumph. A sculpture of the Greek goddess Athena was decapitated.
WHAT IS THE ISLAMIC STATE?
The Islamic State, formerly known as the
Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, is an
Islamist extremist group that wants to
establish an independent Islamic nation in
the Middle East. It was part of Osama bin
Laden's al-Qaeda before breaking away in
2014. It's known for brutal actions, including
beheadings, mass killings and abductions.
WHY TEAR DOWN MONUMENTS?
The Islamic State says its
destruction of artifacts and
monuments is justified by its
strict version of Islam, which
forbids worship of false idols.
The destruction eradicated
links to the past and provoked
Western outrage. The Islamic
State is also believed to be
looting and selling valuable
artifacts to fund its terrorist
activities.
WHAT WAS LOST?
Much of what was destroyed dates back centuries.
Syria has six UNESCO World Heritage sites, some
as old as 3100 B.C. Archaeologists say the region
holds an irreplaceable record of human history that
helps us understand how civilization evolved and
expanded across the Middle East.
