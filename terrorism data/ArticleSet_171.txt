"Europe's top police agency issued a warning on Monday: Islamic State extremists will keep trying attacks on so-called soft targets in Europe as the group increasingly goes global. Less than three months after terrorists killed 130 people in Paris, the Europol agency said in a report: \"There is every reason to expect that ISIS-inspired terrorists or another religiously inspired terrorist group will undertake a terrorist attack somewhere in Europe again, but particularly in France, intended to cause mass casualties\" among civilians.
