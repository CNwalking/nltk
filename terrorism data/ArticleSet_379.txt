"A U.S. government employee, who was editor of a gay rights magazine in Bangladesh, was hacked to death Monday in the capital of Dhaka, officials said.
A group of assailants stormed the home of Xulhaz Mannan, a staffer for the U.S. Agency for International Development, stabbing him and a friend to death, police told The Daily Star. Mannan was a senior editor of Roopbaan, the first gay rights magazine in the country.
The second victim was identified as Tanay Majumder. Police said five or six assailants stormed Mannan's first-floor apartment around 5 p.m. local time.
The U.S. State Department condemned the slaying. \"An act like this is simply beyond words,\" State Department spokesman John Kirby said. Mannan was a staunch supporter of LGBT rights, he said. The U.S. government offered to support Bangladeshi authorities, Kirby said.
The killing took place after Saturday's hacking death of Rezaul Karim Siddiquee, an English professor at Rajshahi University in northern Bangladesh. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for Siddiquee's killing, accusing him of atheism, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, based in Washington.
No one claimed responsibility for Monday's attack on the two men.
The government of Bangladesh condemned Monday's slayings, as well as other killings of secular bloggers in recent months, and blamed the violence on the country's Islamist political opposition.
Shamim Ahmad, a spokesman at the Bangladeshi Embassy in Washington, said authorities \"are determined to catch the culprits soon.\"
