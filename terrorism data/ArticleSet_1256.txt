"ORLANDO, Fla. -- The city announced Friday that the $7 million it collected after the nightclub shooting would be given directly to family members and survivors instead of being distributed through charities and nonprofit groups.
The change was necessary, Mayor Buddy Dyer said, because survivors of the nightclub attack and relatives needed help immediately with expenses like rent and groceries.
\"We are working through exactly the way they are going to do that,\" Mr. Dyer said. \"The most important thing is to do it right, do it transparently and make sure our funders are comfortable with how we are doing this.\"
A charitable and advocacy organization, the National Center for Victims of Crime, which is based in Washington, had criticized Orlando's plan to distribute money via nonprofits, saying that too little money donated in that manner had made its way to victims and their families after similar tragedies. Of the $7 million collected for the OneOrlando fund, Mr. Dyer said, $6.5 million came from corporations.
With the move, Orlando is the latest to shift away from established charities and opt for direct donations, a move that has become increasingly common, in part because of questions about how some charities use donations.
The shooting early Sunday at Pulse, a gay nightclub, left 49 people dead and more than 50 wounded. The gunman, Omar Mateen, 29, claimed allegiance to the Islamic State during a phone call to the authorities in the midst of the attack. Mr. Mateen was killed in a gunfight.
Here in Orlando, the families of victims are already receiving help with funerals and airfare, Mr. Dyer said. In Puerto Rico, a representative of the governor's office said each family was receiving $7,500 to bury loved ones.
Mr. Dyer made the announcement at the Camping World Stadium, once known as the Citrus Bowl, where 35 agencies have set up to offer services to the family members. Already 94 families and 256 people have received help, Mr. Dyer said. The city has also established a board led by Alex Martins, chief executive of the Orlando Magic basketball team, to develop a plan to distribute the money.
The outpouring for Orlando has raised millions through traditional charities and online campaigns, including through crowdfunding websites. On one such site, GoFundMe, more than 300 campaigns have raised $6.2 million, including $5.2 million by Equality Florida, an advocacy group for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people, a GoFundMe spokesman, Dan Pfeiffer, said.
\"There is a real power to being able to give to an individual story and being able to follow that story,\" Mr. Pfeiffer said. \"It is the power of those individual stories.\"
Charity officials said the individual campaigns were also a reflection of the public's concern that their donations get to the people for which they were intended.
After the terrorist attacks in September 2001, the American Red Cross came under intense criticism for collecting millions of dollars in the name of the victims and then making plans to use the money elsewhere. Eventually, the Red Cross agreed to use all of its $543 million Liberty Disaster Fund to assist those affected by the attacks.
Specialists in charitable giving said Orlando's decision could alter how local governments handle the sudden outpouring of money from the public after natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina and mass shootings like the one in Newtown, Conn.
\"There have been so many scandals we've seen after these sorts of situations, so it is a big deal that they've bypassed nonprofits because it shows a distrust in how nonprofits are doing things,\" said Stacy Palmer, editor of The Chronicle of Philanthropy. \"This sends a big message, too, because other cities might decide to use this as a model in the future.\"
Mai Fernandez, executive director of the National Center for Victims of Crime, said Friday that the group, as well as some family members, had told city officials that they feared donations from OneOrlando would not get to victims if a traditional nonprofit was placed in charge.
The organization founded a charity, the National Compassion Fund, in 2014, to ensure that donations made after tragedies go to victims. The group has raised about $5 million for Orlando's victims, Ms. Fernandez said, and will start to distribute the money in the next several weeks.
Kenneth Feinberg, a lawyer who oversaw the federal government's 9/11 victim compensation fund and has become the administrator for a number of such accounts, said Friday that he had consulted with officials in Orlando but had not taken a formal role.
Mr. Feinberg said he believed that people who donate money after tragedies intend it to go directly to victims.
\"There is the understanding that it is a special fund for a special tragedy requiring a special effort,\" he said.
