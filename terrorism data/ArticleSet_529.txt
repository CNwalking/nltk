"The Obama administration approved the release of 15 detainees from the detention camps at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to the United Arab Emirates, a move derided Monday night by a leading member of Congress as reckless.
Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee, called the released detainees \"hardened terrorists\" who will be a threat for years.
\"In its race to close Gitmo, the Obama administration is doubling down on policies that put American lives at risk,\" Royce said in a statement. \"Once again, hardened terrorists are being released to foreign countries where they will be a threat.\"
The Pentagon said in a statement that an interagency review board considered the detainees' potential threat to security and unanimously approved six of the 15 for release, A consensus was reached on releasing the remaining nine. There are 61 detainees left at Guantanamo.
According to the Pentagon, the 15 prisoners are Abd al-Muhsin Abd al-Rab Salih al-Busi, Abd al-Rahman Sulayman, Mohammed Nasir Yahi Khussrof Kazaz, Abdul Muhammad Ahmad Nassar al-Muhajari, Muhammad Ahmad Said al-Adahi, Abdel Qadir al-Mudafari, Mahmud Abd Al Aziz al-Mujahid, Saeed Ahmed Mohammed Abdullah Sarem Jarabh, Mohammed Kamin, Zahar Omar Hamis bin Hamdoun, Hamid al-Razak (aka Haji Hamidullah), Majid Mahmud Abdu Ahmed, Ayub Murshid Ali Salih, Obaidullah and Bashir Nasir Ali al-Marwalah.
Six of the 15 -- al-Busi, Sulayman, Kazaz, al-Muhajari, al-Adahi and al-Mudafari -- were unanimously recommended for release by the interagency Guantanamo Review Task Force, the Pentagon said.
When President Obama took office in 2009, there were 242 detainees in the Guantanamo Bay facility, down from a high of almost 700.
