"Hotels in the quintessentially romantic city are offering Valentine's Day packages and amenities to help counter the dip in tourism attributable to last November's terrorist attacks.
The Left Bank boutique property Hôtel Esprit Saint-Germain will have a concierge who can create customized itineraries of romantic walks, gardens and other spots; couples can also book the four-night Valentine's Day package, which includes a room upgrade and unlimited alcohol in the lobby lounge bar; from 1,350 euros for four nights, or $1,415 at $1.06 to the euro.
The Grand Pigalle Hotel in the South Pigalle (SoPi) neighborhood has its \"From SoPi With Love\" package. Couples arrive to find their room decorated with rose petals and chocolates and get a three-course dinner at its Wine and Dine restaurant, breakfast in bed and either a cocktail mixology course or wine tasting; from 330 euros a night.
The Four Seasons Hotel George V is going the classic route with its Romance Package; included are breakfast, a bottle of Champagne, a 100-euro spa voucher and a bouquet; from 1,560 euros a night. Christian Le Squer, the executive chef of Le Cinq, the hotel's two-Michelin-starred restaurant, has created a nine-course dinner featuring dishes like truffled asparagus and peppered venison in a grape sauce; 750 euros a person.
Romance-seekers can also go for the Valentine's package at Le Meurice, which includes the room, breakfast, a bottle of Champagne and late checkout; from 830 euros a night. The property's Spa Valmont has created the Valentine's Duo Ritual of a warm oil massage and a cocktail; 390 euros a couple.
And Hôtel Plaza Athénée, overlooking the Eiffel Tower, wants to attract lovers with its package of Champagne and sweets upon arrival, breakfast and late checkout; from 1,290 euros a night. Also, the hotel's brasserie, Le Relais Plaza, has a seven-course Feb. 14 menu; 220 euros a person.
\"We want to inspire couples to come to Paris after what we went through last year to celebrate romance in the ultimate destination for it,\" said the property's managing director, François Delahaye. SHIVANI VORA
