"Tuesday's assault on Turkey's largest airport continues a string of deadly terrorist attacks that have struck the country. In the past year, Kurdish and Islamic State militants have executed at least 14 major terrorist attacks across Turkey, killing about 280 people.
Kurdish militants have been in armed conflict with the Turkish government for decades. They attack security forces in southeastern Turkey almost daily, but are increasingly shifting to attacks in urban areas. The Islamic State has never claimed responsibility for any attacks in Turkey, but government officials have linked the group to at least four bombings. While the Kurdish attacks have mainly targeted police and members of the military, the Islamic State attacks have mostly struck at civilians in popular places.
