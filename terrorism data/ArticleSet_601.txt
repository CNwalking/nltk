"French and Belgian investigators have identified a person suspected of directing the deadly terror attacks in Paris and Brussels as Oussama Atar, an Islamic State militant with dual Belgian and Moroccan nationality, according to news media reports Tuesday.
Atar, also known as Abu Ahmad, is suspected of coordinating the attacks from Syria, CNN reported. The broadcaster said Atar is a cousin of the brothers Ibrahim and Khalid El Bakraoui, who blew themselves up on March 22 at the Brussels airport and on the city's subway. The attacks killed 32 people.
Atar was already a suspect in the Brussels assaults and has now been linked to the attacks in Paris on Nov. 13, 2015, that killed 130 people, The Telegraph reported.
French newspaper Le Monde reported that Atar was identified by Adel Haddadi, a suspect he sent from Syria to commit terror attacks in Europe but who didn't reach Paris in time for the November assaults.
