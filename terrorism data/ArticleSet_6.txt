"Casualties among Afghan security forces soared 28% in 2015 as soldiers and police there fought a revitalized Taliban insurgency.
In all, about 16,000 members of Afghanistan's army and police forces were killed or wounded during fighting, according to figures released Monday. That was up from about 12,500 casualties in 2014. The figures compare 2014 and 2015 through mid-December, said Army Col. Michael Lawhorn, a military spokesman in Kabul.
\"We may say we're not in combat operations, but the Afghans are certainly still in this war,\" Army Gen. John Campbell, the top U.S. commander told USA TODAY in an interview last week.
The security situation in Afghanistan deteriorated last year as U.S. forces stepped back from conducing combat operations and reduced their troop levels to 9,800. At the same time, Afghan forces faced a resurgent Taliban as well as al-Qaeda and Islamic State militants.
Campbell, in the interview, said he will travel to Washington soon and will urge senior leaders to maintain at least 9,800 U.S. troops through most of 2016. In October, President Obama announced that U.S. forces would remain in Afghanistan after his presidency, saying the troop level would be brought down to 5,500 this year.
