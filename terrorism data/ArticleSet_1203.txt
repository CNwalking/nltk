"MANILA (AP) -- Philippine officials said Tuesday that the militant group Abu Sayyaf had beheaded a Canadian man, the second Canadian hostage to be killed in two months after the group's demands for a large ransom were not met.
The hostage, Robert Hall, was abducted from a marina in September along with another Canadian, a Norwegian and a Filipino. The other Canadian, John Ridsdel, a former mining executive, was beheaded in April.
Herminio Coloma, a spokesman for President Benigno S. Aquino III, condemned \"the brutal and senseless murder\" of Mr. Hall. He had been held by the Abu Sayyaf in the jungles of southern Sulu Province.
\"This latest heinous crime serves to strengthen our government's resolve to put an end to this reign of terror and banditry,\" he said in a statement.
A militant video obtained by Philippine police officials and seen by The Associated Press showed Mr. Hall in an orange shirt kneeling in front of a black Islamic State-style flag before he was killed in a jungle area.
An Abu Sayyaf deadline for the ransom lapsed Monday, and the police later found a severed head of a Caucasian man outside a Roman Catholic cathedral in Jolo, a major town in Sulu.
In Ottawa, Canada's prime minister, Justin Trudeau said there was \"compelling reason to believe\" that Mr. Hall had been killed by his captors. He said the Canadian government was working with the Philippine authorities to confirm his death.
\"We have every reason to believe that the reports are unfortunately true,\" Mr. Trudeau said. He said he was \"horrified\" by the killings and reaffirmed Canada's refusal to pay ransoms.
