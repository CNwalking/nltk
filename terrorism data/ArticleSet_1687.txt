"PESHAWAR, Pakistan -- At least 22 people were killed in the bombing of a mosque in the western Pakistani tribal region of Mohmand on Friday, officials said.
The explosion occurred during Friday afternoon prayers in Pai Khan, a remote village in the mountainous Ambar subdistrict of Mohmand, a deputy administrator in the region, Naveed Akbar, said by telephone.
Mr. Akbar said that at least 20 more people had been hurt, with seven of the most critically wounded being airlifted to Peshawar, the capital of nearby Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province.
The attack was claimed by Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, a splinter group of the Pakistani Taliban, saying it was targeting local residents who supported the government.
Pakistan's military has claimed major successes against the militants in the country's northwestern regions, but the militants have continued to target government installations and allies.
Afrasiab Khattak, a former senator, said the continuing attacks posed a major challenge for the military. \"The militants are giving a signal that they are still around,\" he said.
The specific form of the bomb was not yet clear, Mr. Akbar said. \"Some people say it was suicide bombing,\" he said. \"Others say the device was already planted in the mosque.\"
A resident said the explosion occurred as the preacher ended his main sermon. \"Just when those in attendance stood up to offer their prayers, there was a shout of Allahu akbar, followed by a big explosion,\" said the witness, Mohammad Ameer, 41.
\"The roof of the veranda came crashing down, and there was thick smoke,\" he said.
