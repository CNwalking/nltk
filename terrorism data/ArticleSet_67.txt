"RIVERSIDE, Calif. -- Enrique Marquez pleaded not guilty Wednesday on charges of supplying two assault weapons that Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik used to massacre 14 people at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino last month. Mr. Marquez, dressed in a white jumpsuit, his legs and hand shackled, spoke in a clear voice as he entered his plea on that charge, as well as on counts that he and Mr. Farook had conspired on an earlier terrorist plot that was not carried out. Answering a series of questions from the United States Magistrate, Sheri Pym, Mr. Marquez said he had been informed of his constitutional rights and read the indictment. The hearing for Mr. Marquez, who is 24 and was a longtime friend of Mr. Farook's, lasted just over four minutes. Ms. Pym set the trial for Feb. 23.
