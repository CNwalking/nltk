"Authorities have detained a \"high level suspect\" north of Paris who was \"at an advanced stage\" of planning a terror attack on French soil, news organizations are reporting that French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said Thursday.
Cazeneuve said the arrest did not appear tied to the recent attack in Brussels, where various news agencies were reporting six arrests were made Thursday following the airport and subway massacre earlier this week. The arrests were made in raids in central Brussels and two other neighborhoods, the Boston Globe reported that prosecutors said.
In France, security forces locked down the area in the Parisian suburb of Argenteuil to conduct a major search, The Guardian reported Cazeneuve said. A building was evacuated and sniffer dogs and mine experts were inspecting, according to The Guardian.
\"These searches follow an arrest by the DGSI (intelligence services) on Thursday morning that allowed us to stop a planned bombing in France that was at an advanced stage,\" The Guardian quoted Cazeneuve as saying.
DGSI stands for Direction Generale de la Securite Interieure which, translated into English, means General Directorate for Internal Security.
The suspect was French and belongs to a terrorist network, Cazeneuve told The Guardian.
Cazeneuve said there were no apparent links between this alleged plot and recent attacks in Brussels or in Paris, Sky News reported.
