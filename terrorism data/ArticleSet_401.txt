"Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi announced Sunday the start of military operations to retake the city of Fallujah, which has been controlled by Islamic State militants for over two years.
In a televised address, al-Abadi said Iraqi forces are \"approaching a moment of great victory\" against the terror group, the Associated Press reported. Al-Abadi reportedly was surrounded by top military commanders as he made the announcement.
Fallujah is about 40 miles west of Baghdad.
The government warned Fallujah residents earlier Sunday to prepare to flee the city or hang white flags outside their homes.
Earlier, Defense Minister Khalid al-Obeidi had said the liberation of Fallujah would begin \"in the coming days\" and asked residents to cooperate with security forces. Military vehicles lined some streets outside the city Sunday, trying to create safe exit routes.
The United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq issued a report last month saying militants were killing residents attempting to leave the city.
Iraqi special forces, backed by coalition air support, recaptured the Anbar provincial capital of Ramadi in December. Since then, Operation Desert Lynx has seen Iraqi military forces liberating a handful of towns from militant control.
Last week, Iraqi soldiers reclaimed Rutbah, which sits on the highway linking Syria with Jordan. Iraq has made consistent gains against the militants on the battlefield in recent months, although suicide bombings and other terror attacks have taken a brutal toll.
