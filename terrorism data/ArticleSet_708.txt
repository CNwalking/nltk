"The events of Sept. 11, 2001, do not seem to be the most obvious fodder for a Broadway musical. But after successful runs at La Jolla Playhouse and Seattle Repertory Theater, \"Come From Away\" -- tracing how the residents of Gander, Newfoundland, took in thousands of diverted airline passengers that terrible day -- will come to New York in the spring of 2017.
Gander, in years past a regular refueling stop for trans-Atlantic flights, was pressed into service on that day 15 years ago when the American and Canadian authorities closed their countries' airspace after the terrorist attacks. Thirty-eight planes and nearly 6,600 civilians descended on the small town, and the generosity shown by the locals has spawned a book (\"The Day the World Came to Town\"), a Canadian TV movie (\"Diverted\") and even a BBC radio play (\"The Day the Planes Came\").
The book, music and lyrics for \"Come From Away\" are by Irene Sankoff and David Hein, a husband-and-wife writing team whose credits include \"My Mother's Lesbian Jewish Wiccan Wedding.\" Christopher Ashley, the artistic director at La Jolla Playhouse and the director of Broadway shows including \"Memphis,\" is the director.
Before Broadway the show will stop in Washington later this year, where it will play at the Ford Theater from Sept. 2 through Oct. 9, and in Toronto, at a theater yet to be announced from Nov. 15 through Jan. 1, 2017. A Broadway theater will be announced later.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
