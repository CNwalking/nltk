"SAN FRANCISCO -- With anxiety heightened three months after terrorists struck a stadium amid a bloody series of attacks in and around Paris, local and federal law enforcement officials said Wednesday that there was no credible threat to Super Bowl 50 and that several measures, many of them not visible to the public, would protect it.
The secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson, flanked by nearly a dozen other law enforcement officials, said security for the game, set for Sunday, and for events surrounding it here this week involved an array of local and federal law enforcement agencies. He said many measures would not be seen by the public, but he did not elaborate.
\"We look forward to a safe and secure and successful Super Bowl,\" said Mr. Johnson, who inspected Levi's Stadium, the site of the game, earlier Wednesday. He said he would not be at the game.
Security is always a concern at the Super Bowl, one of the country's highest-profile events. Last year's game, with 168 million viewers, was the most-watched show in American history.
But security this year has received greater focus by the league and security officials after the attacks in Paris in November, when terrorists struck several venues, including Stade de France in the northern suburb St.-Denis during a match between the French and German soccer teams.
The attackers did not get past the gates of the stadium that night, but their attempt was a reminder that stadiums can be targets.
Mr. Johnson said he had been in contact with his counterpart in France at the Ministry of the Interior. Jeffrey Miller, the head of security for the N.F.L., traveled to France over the summer, before the attacks, as part of a session to share knowledge among international security experts.
\"We're always collectively talking and paying attention to trade craft and things occurring overseas because if we see something happen there, there is a good possibility someone may try to do something like that on U.S. soil,\" Mr. Miller said.
The Super Bowl has a Tier 1 special event assessment rating, which allows federal agencies to spend money to help secure the event. That rating is one level below a national special security event, the highest. The first Super Bowl after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, held in New Orleans, had that designation.
Mr. Miller said a no-fly zone would extend from San Jose, Calif., to near San Francisco International Airport, starting an hour before the game and continuing until midnight. Many fans flying to the game on private jets will arrive in Oakland, Calif., as a result. The temporary flight restriction does not apply to commercial flights controlled by air traffic control.
