"KABUL, Afghanistan -- The Taliban launched their first attack of the new year by setting off a bomb on Friday at a French restaurant in Kabul once popular with foreigners, and gunmen then engaged in a protracted shootout with the police.
A 12-year-old boy was killed and 15 people were wounded, according to doctors at Emergency, a trauma hospital in central Kabul, and a posting on its Twitter account.
Afghan government officials initially said that the attack was under investigation.
The attack targeted Le Jardin, an Afghan-owned restaurant that specializes in French cuisine. It is one of the few restaurants formerly frequented by foreigners that is still open in Kabul. Few foreigners visit it or other such restaurants any longer, however, because of Taliban attacks over the past two years at similar locales.
The attack Friday took place at 5 p.m., before the restaurant was open for customers.
The Afghan police, who offered few details of the attack, cordoned off the area, refused to let residents return to their homes and even blocked access to the site by medical teams.
One woman, who gave her name as Frozan, pleaded with police officers barricading the area to rescue her sister, who was in a home near the restaurant and had been wounded. \"She keeps calling for help, but police are not allowing anyone to come out of their homes, and she is stuck inside losing blood,\" the woman said.
Most of the victims were believed to be civilians living near the restaurant. Le Jardin isin the Taimani neighborhood, where many foreigners live.
The area was the scene last year of the kidnappings of at least two Westerners. They were abducted near their homes and offices.
