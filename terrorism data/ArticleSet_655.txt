"BERLIN -- An Algerian man suspected of training with Islamic State terrorists in Syria and of planning an attack in Germany was taken into custody at a refugee shelter in North Rhine-Westphalia early Thursday as hundreds of police officers carried out raids in three German states, the police said.
The police detained the man, 35, who was not identified in keeping with German law, along with an Algerian woman whose arrest had been sought on different charges, the authorities said.
The Algerian man entered Germany at the Bavarian border last fall, the news service DPA reported, citing security sources. Germany took in more than one million migrants last year and has been on high alert since the Paris terrorist attacks in November that killed 130 people,
A second Algerian man was also detained in the coordinated raids, which began at 6 a.m. in Berlin, Hanover and Attendorn, a town of about 25,000 about an hour's drive northeast of Cologne, a Berlin police spokesman, Stefan Redlich, said.
The police found two other Algerian men they were seeking -- a 31-year-old in Berlin and a 26-year-old in Hanover -- but did not take them formally into custody, the authorities said.
All four men are suspected of links to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, and are believed to have been \"planning a violent act intended to seriously damage the state,\" Mr. Redlich said.
The raids involved 450 police officers, Mr. Redlich said. In Berlin they were centered on four apartments and two businesses; in Attendorn and Hanover the investigation focused on refugee shelters.
The police in North Rhine-Westphalia disclosed last month that a man who had most recently lived at a refugee shelter in the town of Recklinghausen was the lone assailant who was shot and killed in January as he approached a Paris police station on the anniversary of the assault in January 2015 on the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo.
