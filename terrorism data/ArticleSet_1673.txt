"The members of the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce had broken their fasts and left the mosque near Florida's eastern shoreline. In the waning minutes of Sunday, less than an hour later, a surveillance camera recorded a man as he approached the mosque. Then came a flash as flames damaged the house of worship where the man who attacked an Orlando, Fla., nightclub often prayed.
The authorities, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, were investigating the fire as a potential hate crime, even as officials cautioned that they remained uncertain about the motive.
The blaze occurred on the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and nearly three months after Omar Mateen opened fire at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. It also happened around the beginning of Eid al-Adha, a Muslim holiday.
\"Today was supposed to be a day of this community exchanging gifts with their kids, visiting their family members, having dinners, having lunches,\" Wilfredo Ruiz, a spokesman for the mosque, said at a Monday afternoon news conference in Fort Pierce, Fla. \"Instead, they needed to go to another place to worship.\"
No one was injured in the attack, and the St. Lucie County Sheriff's Office sought help identifying the suspect, whom the authorities described as a white or Hispanic male. Video showed the man arriving at the mosque, which is in a former Presbyterian church, about 11:38 p.m. on Sunday, appearing to carry paper and a bottle of some type of liquid.
The camera recorded a flash, presumably when the fire ignited, and the man waved his arms, perhaps from a burn, before he fled on a motorcycle. Officials refused to speculate about a connection between the fire and the anniversary of the terrorist attack.
A spokesman for the Sheriff's Office, Bryan Beaty, declined to discuss whether Mr. Mateen's ties to the mosque might have prompted the fire.
With its painted star and crescent, palm trees and occasional protester outside, the Sunni mosque is central to Islamic life in Fort Pierce, a city of around 44,000 people about an hour's drive north of Palm Beach. Yet it has also been a hub of controversy, drawing attention twice in recent years as a place where young men who staged attacks had worshiped.
In addition to Mr. Mateen, who was killed during the siege at Pulse, which left 49 other people dead, the Islamic Center was a frequent stop for Moner Mohammad Abusalha, who carried out a 2014 suicide bombing in Syria. (The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said the men had known each other \"casually.\")
In June, the Islamic Center's imam, Syed Shafeeq Rahman, distanced himself and the mosque from Mr. Mateen and, more generally, from extremist ideology.
\"There is nothing that he is hearing from me to do killing, to do bloodshed, to do anything, because we never talk like that,\" the imam said of Mr. Mateen.
The mosque, like many in the United States, has expressed concerns about security and the commitment of the local authorities to protect its members and property. Tensions mounted in July after the authorities arrested a 25-year-old man they said had repeatedly punched someone who had been at the Islamic Center to pray. The case is pending in the local circuit court, where a prosecutor said in a filing last month that the accused man had \"evidenced prejudice\" during the attack.
Mr. Beaty said deputies had also investigated two suspicious vehicles and a harassing phone call at the mosque since the June 12 attack in Orlando.
The fire at the Islamic Center is at least the third suspected arson at a Florida mosque this summer. A Tampa mosque was targeted twice in less than 24 hours last month, and a spokesman for the city's Fire Department, Jason A. Penny, said Monday that the inquiry there remained active.
In Fort Pierce on Monday, people responded to the attack with a mix of outrage and sadness.
\"An attack on any house of worship is an attack on all houses of worship,\" said Ahmed Bedier, a Muslim activist in Florida. \"It's unacceptable.\"
