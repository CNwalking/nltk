"EgyptAir Capt. Khaled Darwish landed here Thursday after a flight on its way to Cairo crashed with 66 people on board.
He said that disaster won't deter him from flying for the state-owned carrier.
\"My company is a good company,\" Darwish said. \"I don't have any reasons to be upset at them.\"
EgyptAir Flight 804 crashed into the Mediterranean Sea while en route from Paris to Cairo. \"I am very upset about it, but I don't know what happened,\" he said.
Paula Alina, an airport worker checking boarding passes for the next EgyptAir flight bound for Cairo, said she has seen many passengers in tears out of fear ever since last year's terror attacks in Paris.
\"It is heartbreaking. I feel afraid for them,\" Alina said about those boarding the flight. Alina said ground staff at the French airport put on a brave face for the passengers.
\"I don't speak to them. Otherwise, I would show them that we are worried for them,\" she said.
In Cairo, family members of passengers and crew aboard the downed jet sat in the modest restaurant at the Le Passage hotel next to the airport.
\"Only God knows what happened to them,\" said Mohammed Diab, whose nephew Mohammed Farag Diab, 25, was one of three air marshals on the flight.
\"All they have told us is the plane is missing,\" the tearful 72-year-old uncle said as Egyptian television broadcast news about the jet. \"He had been working for EgyptAir for five years, and he loved his job.\"
