"His tenure marked by terror attacks and mass shootings, President Obama has reached a sad milestone in his presidency: He has ordered the lowering of the nation's flags to half-staff more often than any other president in history.
Sunday, Obama extended that unenviable streak, ordering all flags at federal buildings and ships at sea to be flown at half-staff to honor the 49 victims of the Orlando nightclub shooting.
Those flags will remain at half-staff until sunset Thursday, meaning the nation will spend most of National Flag Week -- proclaimed by Obama in a separate order last Friday -- with the stars and stripes in a mournful pose.
Since 2009, Obama has issued 66 proclamations to fly the flag at half-staff, exceeding President George W. Bush's 58 and Bill Clinton's 50, according to a USA TODAY analysis of presidential proclamations.
Annual observances such as Memorial Day and Pearl Harbor day contributed to that total, as have the deaths of notable public figures such as Sen. Robert Byrd, Sen. Ted Kennedy, former first lady Nancy Reagan and Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
But it's a spate of national tragedies -- from the Fort Hood shooting that claimed 13 lives in 2009 to the most recent carnage in Orlando -- that have distinguished the Obama presidency. Fourteen proclamations honoring the victims of those tragedies have accounted for 79 days when the flag over the White House was at half-staff, more than half of the 158-day total under Obama.
