"Islamic State militants attempted to capture an oil port along Libya's coast early Monday, in fighting that left at least seven people dead and set fire to a storage tank of crude oil, according to witnesses. The militants began their assault on the Sidra oil port with suicide bomb attacks on a checkpoint, but by Monday afternoon, the offensive had been beaten back by guards. The Islamic State in Libya is regarded as one of the most dangerous affiliates of the extremist group outside of Iraq and Syria, and has gained strength in Libya by capitalizing on infighting among various armed factions. The attack on Monday was at least the second by the Islamic State on the Sidra port, and showed the determination of the group to expand its territory beyond its stronghold in the western Libyan town of Surt.
