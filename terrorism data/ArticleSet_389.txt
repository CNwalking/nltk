"The Islamic State's bombings in Baghdad on Wednesday, the deadliest this year, reflect \"desperate\" attempts by the militant group to reverse a series of defeats by Iraqi forces and a U.S.-led coalition, the U.S. military said.
Three separate bombings in the Iraqi capital killed at least 93 people and injured 165, according to the Associated Press.
\"As the enemy loses more and more terrain, they resort to some of these desperate acts,\" Army Maj. Gen. Gary Volesky said from Baghdad.
The strikes could be an effort by the militants to divert the Iraqi government's attention from its main offensives elsewhere against the Islamic State by forcing it to bring troops back to defend the capital. Iraq's U.S.-backed military has put the radical fighters on the defense.
Volesky said Iraq's government has not called for repositioning forces that would take soldiers away to defend the capital.
The Pentagon estimates Iraqi forces, aided by allies' airstrikes and advisers, have retaken 40% of the territory the Islamic State controlled at its peak strength last year. Still, the bombings show militants can penetrate the capital's defenses to launch terrorist strikes against civilians, who are more frequent targets as the Islamic State's losses mount.
The largest attack was a car bombing in a commercial section of Sadr City. It killed at least 63 people, according to the AP. Later, two other car bombs in different neighborhoods killed at least 30 people.
The bombing of a soccer stadium south of Baghdad in March killed at least 30 people. Twin bombings in Baghdad in February killed 70 people.
Iraq's forces are engaged in preliminary operations to retake Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, from Islamic State control and clear the Euphrates River Valley, where Iraq's military expelled the militants from Ramadi.
