"BERLIN -- More than 200 police officers and intelligence agents raided an office and 12 homes in the northern German city-state of Bremen on Tuesday to enforce a ban on a Salafist group linked to a previously outlawed group that sent at least 15 people to join the Islamic State in Syria, the authorities said.
The police confiscated several computers, hard drives and cellphones in the coordinated raids, said Ulrich Mäurer, Bremen's top official for internal affairs. The office of the group, known as the Islamic Support Association, functioned as a mosque, similar to a mosque run by a previous Salafist group that sent fighters to train in Syria, where six of them have been killed, Mr. Mäurer said.
The authorities have voiced fears that Salafist groups are recruiting new members from the wave of migrants who have entered Germany in recent months, many from the Middle East. No arrests were made on Tuesday.
The police will sift through confiscated material for more clues, Mr. Mäurer said, and will be monitoring a Bremen Salafist who will be released from prison in the coming weeks.
