"One man connected with the armed takeover of a federal wildlife refuge in rural Oregon was arrested, and a second was held in the disappearance of a vehicle from the refuge, the authorities said Friday. Both arrests were made without incident and far from the refuge itself. Kenneth Medenbach, 62, was arrested Friday at a grocery in Burns on probable cause for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle that the police said was the property of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, about 30 miles away. Brian Cavalier, who identified himself as \"Fluffy Unicorn,\" and as a bodyguard of the militant group's leader, Ammon Bundy, was arrested earlier in the week in Buckeye, Ariz., on a criminal warrant during the investigation of a suspicious vehicle. He was later released by a judge. A Buckeye police spokesman on Friday said Arizona law prevented disclosure of arrest warrant details. Protesters have occupied the refuge headquarters buildings since Jan. 2.
