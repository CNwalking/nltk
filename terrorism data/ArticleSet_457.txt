"A day after Democrats seized the Senate floor and spoke for nearly 15 hours demanding action on gun bills, Republicans agreed Thursday to schedule votes on Democratic-sponsored legislation that would ban gun sales to suspected terrorists and expand background checks for gun buyers.
They debated which gun measures their side would offer for consideration.
\"We're trying to figure that out,\" Majority Whip Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said Thursday.
Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who led the 15-hour protest from noon Wednesday to the wee hours of Thursday morning, said his office received 10,000 calls of support. \"My legs are a little bit rubbery, but my heart is strong this morning, because I know that we made a difference yesterday,\" he said on Capitol Hill. \"And I know that we galvanized support all across this country.\"
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky dismissed it as a \"campaign talk-a-thon\" that delayed action on the bills lawmakers wanted considered.
Cornyn said he expects a measure he sponsored will be among GOP legislation offered for consideration. It would allow federal law enforcement officials to delay a gun sale to a suspected terrorist for three days, then halt the sale but only after proving probable cause before a judge.
