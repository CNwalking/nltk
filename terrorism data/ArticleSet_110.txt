"The State Department on Thursday designated the Afghan affiliate of the Islamic State, a splinter group mostly made up of former Afghan and Pakistani Taliban members, as a foreign terrorist organization.
The designation allows the government to impose economic sanctions on members of the group and those who do business with them. It also allows United States military operations against them in Afghanistan to fall under the official counterterrorism mission agreed to by the Afghan government. The designation comes as increased American involvement in combat there has drawn concern about outstripping the military's legal mandate.
The listing also draws a stronger public connection between the main Islamic State command in Syria and Iraq, known as ISIS or ISIL, and the Afghan splinter group, even though most officials say the Afghan cell has drawn little more than inspiration and its name from the Islamic State. Only two other groups that have claimed loyalty to the Islamic State have made the terrorist list: Boko Haram, based in northeastern Nigeria, and the Sinai Province of the Islamic State, in Egypt.
The Afghan affiliate, sometimes referred to as ISIL-K or ISK, is formally known as the Islamic State in Khorasan, a historical reference to a broad area encompassing parts of Iran, Central Asia and Afghanistan that featured prominently in Islamic prophecy.
Many groups with strong connections to the Afghan Taliban have already been listed by the State Department, even though the main Taliban insurgency itself is not. Those other groups include the Haqqani Network, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, known as the Pakistani Taliban.
