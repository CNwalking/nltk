"Holland America is the latest cruise line to cut back on Mediterranean sailings amid weak bookings. The Seattle-based line has canceled plans to deploy the 1,848-passenger Oosterdam to the region for summer 2017, saying the ship instead will head to Alaska for the season. The move comes just six weeks after Celebrity Cruises announced plans to pull the 2,850-passenger Celebrity Equinox from Europe for next summer. That ship instead will sail the Caribbean.
Demand for Mediterranean sailings has softened notably this year in the wake of terrorist attacks across Europe and an attempted coup in Turkey. Demand for sailings in the Eastern Mediterranean has been particularly affected.
Holland America in recent days also canceled calls in Turkey for the rest of the year. Six Mediterranean voyages scheduled this month through October no longer will include stops in the country.
Holland America was one of only a handful of major cruise lines to keep 2016 calls in Turkey on its schedule after terrorist attacks in the country this year. Crystal Cruises, Disney Cruise Line, Costa Cruises, MSC Cruises, Norwegian Cruise Line, Regent Seven Seas Cruises, Windstar Cruises and Oceania Cruises all had already canceled visits to Turkey for 2016. Norwegian, Regent and Oceania also have dropped calls in Turkey for 2017.
