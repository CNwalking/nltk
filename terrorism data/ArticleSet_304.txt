"A wave of tech companies that include the industry's biggest names filed court statements backing Apple in its battle with the federal government over access to a killer's iPhone.
Twitter was one of 17 allied tech firms filing a federal court amicus brief Thursday, a group that includes Airbnb, LinkedIn and eBay. AT&T and Intel each did the same, along with the Electronic Frontier Foundation and 46 technologists, researchers and cryptographers.
A second coalition that grouped 15 mature tech companies with younger start-ups -- including Google, Facebook, Amazon, Cisco, Microsoft, Mozilla, Snapchat, Box, Slack and Yahoo -- also filed in support of Apple, urging the court to exercise caution in applying a legal decision from an era when cellphones and the Internet were unheard of. \"(The government request) is an overreach; it is asking a tech company to undermine years of security,\" Mozilla chief legal officer Denelle Dixon-Thayer told USA TODAY.
Apple is getting broad tech world support for its refusal to comply with an order from a judge in California who said Apple should help the FBI unlock an iPhone used by one of the killers in the San Bernardino mass shooting in December.
\"This case isn't simply about letting the FBI pick the lock to a dead terrorist's phone. It's about whether governments can conscript private companies to disable security features built into their devices,\" said Ron Bell, general counsel at Yahoo.
