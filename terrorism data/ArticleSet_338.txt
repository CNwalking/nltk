"Authorities had been scouring Molenbeek, a North African enclave here, since the Islamic State staged terrorist attacks in Paris last November. Now another immigrant district -- Schaerbeek -- is in the spotlight.
On Wednesday, police discovered explosives, other chemicals used to make bombs, and the black flag of the Islamic State in a Schaerbeek apartment, according to Belgian media reports.
\"Everyone was nervous,\" said Emma Raulin, 24, a Brussels resident on her way to work. \"There were a lot of soldiers. No one was talking, just sitting in the metro playing on their mobile phones. The atmosphere was very tense.\"
Police later said Najim Laachraoui, 24, an alleged Islamic State bombmaker and Schaerbeek native, was among the suicide bombers in the attacks Tuesday.
Home to 130,000 people, Schaerbeek is a mix of Turkish, Moroccan and other immigrants who often settle first in Molenbeek, home to some of the Paris bombers, and then move to Schaerbeek after getting better paying jobs. Despite the gentrification that sections of Schaerbeek have experienced in the past decade, there remain pockets of poor North African Muslims who might sympathize with Islamic State's violent, anti-Western ideology.
Schaerbeek has densely packed neighborhoods, a red light district and a major railway station. \"You have beautiful tree-lined lanes leading directly into ghastly slum quarters,\" said Alan Hope, 59, a contributing editor for the English-language news publication Flanders Today and a 23-year-long resident of Schaerbeek. \"All of those characteristics help to make it a place where criminals are concentrated.\"
