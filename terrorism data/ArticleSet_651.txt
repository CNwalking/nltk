"A man whose lawyer says he is mentally ill pleaded guilty Wednesday in a plot to plant a bomb outside an Army post, acknowledging that he wanted to aid the Islamic State group. John T. Booker Jr. of Topeka admitted in court to trying to set off what he thought was a 1,000-pound bomb in a van outside Fort Riley. A plea deal with prosecutors that recommends he spend 30 years in prison. Mr. Booker, 21, was arrested outside the post in April 2015 as he was trying to arm what he believed was the bomb. He had been plotting with two contacts who actually were confidential F.B.I. sources. His lawyer, Kirk Redmond, told Judge Carlos Murguia of Federal District Court that Mr. Booker had been given a diagnosis of bipolar disorder but he did not say whether the disorder was a factor in Mr. Booker's actions. Mr. Booker pleaded guilty to one count of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction and one count of attempting to destroy government property with an explosive device.
