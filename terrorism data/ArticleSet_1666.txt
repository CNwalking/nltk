"SYDNEY, Australia -- A man who stabbed and critically wounded another man in a park in a Sydney suburb on Saturday was inspired by Islamic State extremists, the police here said on Sunday.
Catherine Burn, a deputy police commissioner for the state of New South Wales, said at news conference that a 22-year-old Sydney man, whom police did not name, had been charged with committing an act of terrorism and attempted murder. He was expected to appear in court on Sunday morning.
Ms. Burn said the man was known to the police for other unrelated crimes.
\"We will be alleging before court this was an act that was inspired by ISIS,\" she said. \"It was a deliberate act yesterday. It resulted in a person receiving extremely serious injuries.\"
The unidentified 59-year-old victim was attacked while walking through a nature reserve in Minto, about 30 miles southwest of downtown Sydney. He was listed in serious condition at an area hospital.
The police said that the two men did not know each other.
\"We know that this person has strong, extremist beliefs inspired by ISIS,\" Ms. Burn said at the news conference. \"What made him act we don't know.\" She said that counterterrorism police officers had searched the man's home and found material that linked him to the extremist group.
On Thursday, the New South Wales police arrested another man, 18, in an unrelated incident at the Sydney Opera House. He was charged with threatening to destroy or damage property, after the police arrested him outside the well-known music venue.
Last week, Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister, warned that the Islamic State had called for so-called lone-wolf terror attacks at popular tourist sites in Australia, including the Opera House and at Bondi Beach.
