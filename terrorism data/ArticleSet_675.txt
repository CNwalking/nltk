"An Army deserter who called Osama bin Laden \"a beautiful man,\" made statements supporting the Islamic State group and called for the death of American troops has been charged with illegally possessing firearms, federal prosecutors said Monday. Daniel Seth Franey, 33, of Montesano, was barred from having guns because he was subject to a protection order taken out by his former partner, but he joined an undercover agent in making what he believed were black-market gun deliveries, according to a criminal complaint unsealed in United States District Court in Tacoma. Mr. Franey faces five counts of unlawful gun possession but no terrorism charges. In recorded conversations with the undercover agent, he made reference to possibly attacking soldiers at Joint Base Lewis-McChord and traveling overseas to join the radical militants, but he also said he did not want to kill anyone and wanted a gun to have at home only for protection from law enforcement.
