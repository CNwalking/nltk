"The French prime minister, Manuel Valls, said it was \"vital\" to stage the European Championship in France to show that the country would not cower in the wake of the recent terror attacks in Brussels and Paris.
\"Big sporting events, big cultural events, are vital to show that we are a free people standing on our feet, that we're not scared, that we know we're facing up to a terrorist threat,\" Valls said on Europe 1 radio.
Bernard Cazeneuve, the French interior minister, said that all possible measures would be taken to guarantee the tightest security at Euro 2016, which begins June 10.
