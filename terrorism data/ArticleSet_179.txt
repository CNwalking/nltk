"The terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb released a video of a Swiss nun who had been kidnapped in northern Mali nearly three weeks ago in the first claim of responsibility for the hostage-taking, the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors jihadist communications, said Tuesday on its website. The video outlined the conditions for the release of the nun, Beatrice Stockly, including the release of members of the group jailed by Mali. Ms. Stockly, who had been kidnapped once before in 2012, appeared in a veil and stated that the footage was filmed on Jan. 19 in the eight-minute video, which could not be independently verified. In the video, an English-speaking fighter said that through her work, Ms. Stockly \"drove out many from the fold of Islam by seducing them with crumbs of this worldly life.\" AQIM has claimed responsibility for recent attacks in Mali and Burkina Faso.
