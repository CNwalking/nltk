"Italy has agreed to allow American armed drones to take off from an air base in Sicily to defend the coalition force fighting Islamic State extremists in Libya. An Italian Defense Ministry official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the government had not announced the accord, said leaders in Rome and Washington reached the agreement last month. Permission will have to be asked of the Italian government each time, case by case, for the drones to take off to defend military personnel at risk during operations against the Islamic State, which is gaining ground in Libya.
