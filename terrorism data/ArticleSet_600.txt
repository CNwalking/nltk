"The special House committee that investigated the 2012 terror attacks in Benghazi, Libya, is still alive four months after issuing its report, but Republicans say it is winding down and won't expand into other aspects of Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of State.
The Select Committee on Benghazi, which has spent more than $7.8 million over two years, is still up and running with staff preparing documents and transcripts for public release.
In addition to the panel's 800-page report issued June 28, Republicans are trying to get various federal agencies to declassify records gathered, including emails and witness interview transcripts. In response, a handful of Democratic staff have stayed on to monitor the process.
Rep. Trey Gowdy, the South Carolina Republican who chairs the panel, said earlier that the documents would supplement the report and publishing them would be the committee's final task before formally filing all the material with the House and shutting down the committee.
If the committee does not finish by the end of the year, the House would have to approve an extension for it to continue into 2017, but that appeared unlikely.
\"The Benghazi investigation has been completed and the committee is in the process of clearing documents with the administration and archiving records,\" Republican panel spokesman Jamal Ware said Friday.
The House created the committee in May 2014 to compile a definitive account of the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, in which four Americans were killed, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens.
