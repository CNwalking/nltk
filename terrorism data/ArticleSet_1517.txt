"PARIS -- A man carrying a machete and shouting \"Allahu akbar\" injured two police officers outside a police station in central Belgium on Saturday afternoon.
The attack was announced on Twitter by the police in Charleroi, a city of more than 200,000 about 31 miles south of Brussels. The police station was sealed off.
The Charleroi police said on Twitter that the assailant had been shot and died of his wounds, and that the officers' injuries were not life-threatening.
The attack was quickly denounced by Belgian officials.
\"I strongly condemn the attack in Charleroi,\" Prime Minister Charles Michel said on Twitter. \"Thoughts go to the victims, their families and the police. We are following the situation closely.\"
Interior Minister Jan Jambon called the attack \"despicable.\" He said the country's Coordinating Body for Threat Analysis, which monitors intelligence on terrorism and other threats, was monitoring the situation.
A safe house was rented in Charleroi by Islamic State terrorists who were involved in the deadly assaults in and around Paris on Nov. 13 and Brussels on March 22.
The police in France and Belgium have been on heightened alert because of those attacks, as well as attacks targeting the police.
In January, a knife-wielding man wearing a fake explosives vest and shouting \"Allahu akbar\" was shot dead outside a police station in northern Paris, and in June, a police captain and his wife were killed in their home in Magnanville, France, about 34 miles west of Paris, by a man who had been convicted of terrorism-related charges and who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State.
