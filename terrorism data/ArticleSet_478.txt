"At least 30 people were killed and 60 injured Tuesday in an attack at Ataturk International Airport by three suicide bombers who blew themselves up, Istanbul Gov. Vasip Sahin said.
After the blasts, panicked travelers cowered in stores, and ambulances wheeled the injured away.
Two South African tourists, Paul and Susie Roos, were at the airport to fly home and were shaken by what they saw. \"We came up from the arrivals to the departures when we heard these shots going off,\" Paul Roos told the Associated Press. \"There was this guy going roaming around, he was dressed in black, and he had a handgun.\"
Tuesday's bombing is the latest in a wave of terror attacks in Turkey as the country grapples with a spillover from the civil war raging in neighboring Syria.
No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack at Turkey's largest airport -- the third-busiest in Europe. The government in Ankara has blamed Islamic State terrorists or Kurdish separatists for recent attacks.
