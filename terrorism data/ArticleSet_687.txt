"KABUL, Afghanistan -- An Afghan policeman shot by a NATO coalition soldier has died of his wounds after apparently conducting an insider attack, the government said on Wednesday.
The policeman had been guarding the Commerce Ministry early Tuesday afternoon when he fired on coalition soldiers \"for unknown reasons,\" the Interior Ministry said in a statement. The coalition troops returned fire, wounding the policeman, who was taken to a hospital but died of his injuries on Wednesday, the statement said.
The frequency of insider violence by the Afghan forces against American or other NATO troops, sometimes called \"green on blue,\" has dropped sharply since the departure of most foreign combat troops in 2014. But a wave of the attacks in 2013 and 2014 led to intensified security measures and greatly increased tensions even as American trainers were working most closely with the Afghan forces. Although some attacks have been attributed to Taliban infiltration plots, most have seemed to come out of personal grudges or outrage.
One such attack, in August 2014, led to the first death of an American general in an overseas conflict since the Vietnam War: Maj. Gen. Harold J. Greene was killed and more than a dozen American and Afghan officers were wounded when an Afghan soldier opened fire with an automatic weapon at the military academy in Kabul. An investigation found that the soldier had acted alone and probably on a whim.
In a statement on Wednesday, Col. Michael T. Lawhorn, a spokesman for the United States military in Kabul, said, \"Initial reports indicate that a man dressed in an Afghan National Defense Security Forces uniform opened fire on coalition forces, and that the man had been wounded in the exchange of gunfire.\" Colonel Lawhorn declined to give further details about the attack.
