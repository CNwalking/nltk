"NEW DELHI -- A gun battle at an Indian Air Force base entered its third day on Monday as Indian security officials announced they had killed a fifth gunman.
At least six gunmen infiltrated a large Indian Air Force base in Pathankot, Punjab, near the Pakistan border on Saturday. They have killed at least seven Indian soldiers and wounded at least 20.
\"The operations are still going on,\" Dushyant Singh, an inspector general in India's National Security Guards, an elite commando force, told reporters at a news conference. \"We have been able to eliminate a fifth terrorist.\"
Arun Jaitley, India's finance minister, described the gunmen as a \"well-trained suicidal squad.\"
\"Their main aim was to damage our strategic assets at Pathankot air base,\" he said.
When asked about the identities of the gunmen and whether the attack would affect ties between India and Pakistan, Mr. Jaitley declined to comment. He said that the air base was very large, with a circumference of 15 miles, and that it would take time to search the area.
The gunmen were initially confined to a two-story barracks on Saturday, security officials said at the news conference.
