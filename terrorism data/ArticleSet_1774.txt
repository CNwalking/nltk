"AMMAN, Jordan -- A leading figure in Al Qaeda who became a prominent member of its Syrian offshoot, the Nusra Front, was killed in a drone attack on Monday, according to the group.
Abu Faraj al-Masri, who spent years in prison in his native Egypt on charges of plotting with fundamentalist Islamist groups and later left for Afghanistan, reportedly died when the vehicle in which he was traveling was hit in rebel-held Idlib in Syria's northwest.
The United States Defense Department said in a statement that Mr. Masri had been the target of an American airstrike near Idlib on Monday. \"We are still assessing the results of the strike,\" the statement said.
Since the U.S.-led coalition began operations in Syria, primarily against Islamic State militants, airstrikes have also targeted Nusra Front figures, killing scores.
In one of Mr. Masri's last public appearances, he was seen alongside the former Nusra leader Abu Mohamad al-Jolani when the group announced in July that it was renaming itself the Levant Conquest Front in an apparent effort to distance itself from Al Qaeda.
Washington dismissed that move as cosmetic and said it would continue to target the group as a terrorist organization.
Last month, Abu Hajer al-Homsi, the group's top commander, was killed in an airstrike in rural Aleppo Province.
Mr. Masri was one of the early leaders of the radical Egyptian Islamic Jihad movement. He was arrested after the assassination of President Anwar Sadat in 1981 and spent seven years in prison before leaving for Afghanistan in the late 1980s.
He was also held secretly under a C.I.A. rendition program after his arrest in Azerbaijan in 1998.
