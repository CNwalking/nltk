"JERUSALEM -- The Israeli Air Force struck a target along the border with northern Gaza on Wednesday, hitting what the military said was a squad of Palestinian militants planning to attack Israeli forces in the area with a bomb.
The missile strike killed a Palestinian man, Mousa Zuaitar, 33, and wounded three more, according to Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency.
Israeli airstrikes and explosions along Israel's border with Gaza have been rare since August 2014, when a cease-fire ended 50 days of fighting between Israel and Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls the coastal territory, although occasional rocket attacks and sniper fire against Israel have been reported.
Hamas has largely enforced the cease-fire, but some smaller groups, waging their own battles with the militant group, have occasionally tried to undermine it.
At a funeral procession that set out from Mr. Zuaitar's home in the Jabaliya refugee camp later on Wednesday, his body was covered in a flag of the Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, whose Gaza branch is loosely affiliated with the Fatah party led by President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, Hamas's main rival.
Israeli forces have fatally shot more than 20 Palestinians during clashes along the Gaza border in recent months, in some cases when Palestinian protesters have tried to breach the border fence.
The Israeli military said that it carried out Wednesday's airstrike in a joint operation with the Shin Bet security agency, suggesting that there was prior intelligence about the target.
\"Forces guarding the border with Gaza face a growing threat from hostile terror groups attempting to destabilize the situation,\" said Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the Israeli military.
