"A series of bombings across Saudi Arabia on Monday brought death and fear to the Sunni nation as the holy month of Ramadan edged closer to a violent conclusion across the region.
The Islamic State issued a communique before Ramadan, imploring jihadis to \"make it, with God's permission, a month of pain for infidels everywhere.\" The militant group claimed responsibility for attacks in Iraq and Bangladesh and is suspected in another in Turkey that together killed hundreds in the past week.
The Islamic State did not immediately claim responsibility for any of the Saudi blasts.
An attack Monday in the western city of Medina targeted security forces near Al-Haram al-Nabawi, a mosque built by the prophet Mohammed and one of the holiest in Islam. Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry said in a statement that four security officers were killed and five others were wounded.
Also Monday, a suicide bomber blew himself up near a Shiite mosque in Qatif.
