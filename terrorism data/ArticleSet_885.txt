"Assailants with knives killed a Christian convert in northern Bangladesh on Tuesday, the latest in a series of attacks on liberal activists, members of minority Muslim sects and members of other religious groups in the Muslim-majority nation. Three attackers on a motorbike stabbed the victim, Hossain Ali, 68, in Kurigram, north of Dhaka, the capital, the police said. Mr. Ali converted to Christianity from Islam in 1999, said the Kurigram district police chief, Tobarak Ullah. Chief Ullah said the killing bore the hallmarks of recent attacks by Islamist militants.
