"The F.B.I. said Thursday that there was no indication that the man who ambushed a Philadelphia policeman was part of an organized terror cell. James B. Comey, the director of the F.B.I., also said the attack did not appear to involve a plot beyond the Jan. 7 shooting that injured Officer Jesse Hartnett. The police said that Edward Archer of Yeadon, Pa., who is charged with attempted murder, told them he was acting in the name of Islam when he fired on the officer's cruiser. A tipster told the police that the gunman was part of a group that included three others. The police had said they were not sure of the tip's credibility.
