"The Bataclan, the Paris concert hall where scores of people were killed in the terrorist attack of Nov. 13, on Wednesday announced its first slate of shows since then. The hall has not held a concert since terrorists opened fire during an Eagles of Death Metal concert.
It will reopen later this year and on Nov. 16 will present a concert from the British rocker Pete Doherty, according to a statement posted on its Twitter and Facebook accounts, and information on its website.
November and December appearances by Youssou N'Dour, Nada Surf, and MZ will follow. Further events will be announced soon, the statement on the company's social media accounts said. Details on the concerts are available on the Bataclan's website.
In February the Bataclan announced that it was undergoing a major renovation, and aimed to reopen by the end of this year, though the exact date when it would open to the public again has not been announced.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
