"A court on Tuesday sentenced seven men for conspiring with the Islamic State group, the first time Indonesia has sent anyone to prison for links to the group. The court found four of the men guilty of violating Indonesia's antiterrorism law by attending Islamic State training sessions. They were sentenced to prison terms of three to four years. Two recruiters were sentenced to similar terms for helping them go to Syria. The seventh received a five-year sentence for spreading Islamic State propaganda.
