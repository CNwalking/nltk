"MOGADISHU, Somalia -- Islamist militants claimed responsibility for an attack on a seaside restaurant here on Thursday evening that killed at least seven people and wounded two others, according to state media.
The Shabab, a group that has vowed to turn Somalia into a puritanical Islamic state, claimed responsibility for the attack.
Gunmen raided the building after setting off a car bomb, police officials and the insurgent group said, according to Reuters.
Khadar Keeyow, a well-known Somali singer who was near the scene, said, \"I heard a large explosion, I went outside, and I saw the dead bodies of three people; two were women.\"
Abdirizak Omar Mohamed, Somalia's minister of national security, said three Shabab militants had stormed the restaurant.
Somali security officials said a suicide bomber had survived the blast and was taken into custody and that two militants had been killed.
The Banadir restaurant at Lido beach, where the attack occurred, is near the compound of the new Turkish Embassy in Mogadishu, Somalia's capital, according to Reuters.
Many of the wounded were transferred to hospitals in critical condition, and the death toll was expected to rise.
The Shabab have carried out a series of deadly attacks in Somalia to try to topple the Western-backed government of this poor, unstable country. In January, militants stormed another restaurant on Lido beach, killing 17 people.
On Sunday, more than 20 people were killed when suicide bombers detonated two car bombs at a local government headquarters in the semiautonomous Puntland region in northeastern Somalia.
