"Moroccan officials announced Monday that they had detained a Belgian man thought to be a close friend of one of the leaders of the attacks in Paris on Nov. 13. The man, whom Belgian and Moroccan news sources identified as Gelel Attar, is of Belgian and Moroccan background, as were most of those who participated in the attacks. Mr. Attar was sentenced in absentia at a trial last summer in Belgium to five years in prison for involvement in a terrorist network. Two of the Paris attackers were also sentenced in absentia in that trial: Abdelhamid Abaaoud, who helped organize the attacks, and Chakib Akrouh, one of the attackers.
