"In his first visit to an American mosque, President Obama on Wednesday condemned \"inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim Americans that has no place in our country.\"
Speaking to Muslim Americans at the Islamic Society of Baltimore, Obama called for unity among American faith communities, recognized the contributions of Muslim citizens and asked for Muslims around the world to help combat the extremist ideologies of groups like the Islamic State.
\"The first thing I want to say is two words that Muslim Americans don't hear often enough,\" Obama said. \"Thank you. Thank you for serving your community. Thank you for lifting up the lives of your neighbors and for helping keep us strong and united as one American family.\"
He decried the surge of threats and intimidation of American Muslim communities following the terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif., last year.
\"Like all Americans, you're worried about the threat of terrorism, but on top of that, as Muslim-Americans, you also have another concern, and that is your entire community so often is targeted or blamed for the violent acts of the very few,\" Obama said.
\"We've seen children bullied, we've seen mosques vandalized,\" he said. \"It's not who we are. We're one American family. And when any part of our family begins to feel separate or second class or targeted, it tears at the very fabric of our nation.\"
Obama's remarks continued a not-so-veiled White House campaign to rebuff the campaign rhetoric of Donald Trump, who has promised to conduct surveillance on mosques and temporarily ban Muslims from entering the U.S. The speech comes amid an eight-day stretch during which Obama will have spoken to Jewish, Muslim and Christian audiences.
