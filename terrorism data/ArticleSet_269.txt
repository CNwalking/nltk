"A faction of the Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility Monday for shooting a man to death at a hotel in Dublin and injuring two others, the BBC reported.
An unnamed man who said he spoke on behalf of the Continuity IRA told the British broadcaster that the group was responsible for Friday's incident at the Regency Hotel. His claim couldn't be independently verified.
Irish media identified the dead man as David Byrne, 33. The hotel was hosting a weigh-in for a boxing tournament when at least six attackers, some disguised as police officers, opened fire with semiautomatic weapons, police said.
The Continuity IRA said Byrne was targeted because he was involved in the shooting death of Alan Ryan, a member of another dissident group -- the Real IRA -- in 2012, the BBC reported. The group said more attacks were planned on drug dealers and other criminals, the broadcaster reported.
Irish state broadcaster RTE said 200 to 300 people were at the weigh-in ahead of the World Boxing Organization European Lightweight title fight. WBO canceled the fight, which had been scheduled for Saturday.
The IRA's roots trace back to the war of independence that led to Ireland's partition. It has had a number of factions and splinter groups, including the Provisional IRA and Real IRA. The Continuity IRA is opposed to the peace process in place since the 1990s and rejects decommissioning of weapons, according to TRAC, a terrorism research organization.
