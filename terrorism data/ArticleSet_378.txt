"President Obama has approved sending another 250 U.S. military personnel to Syria to help opposition forces battle the Islamic State, an administration official confirmed Sunday.
Obama is expected to make the announcement Monday in a speech here as he completes a week-long foreign trip.
The U.S. personnel will not be engaged in direct combat but will advise the units and can help coordinate airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition, the official said.
The 250 would join 50 U.S. advisers the White House had earlier authorized for Syria, where they are helping a patchwork of Kurdish and Arab fighters battling the Islamic State in northeastern Syria. There is no timeline yet for deploying the new forces.
The administration official asked not be named because the announcement has not yet been made.
The additional personnel follows last week's announcement to send another 217 military personnel to Iraq. \"The issue for us is identifying yet more ways to accelerate the campaign\" against the Islamic State, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said recently.
At a news conference Sunday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Obama repeated his reluctance to create a \"safe zone\" in Syria for the thousands of people fleeing the conflict because it would require a large military commitment and ground troops.
Merkel has previously expressed approval of the idea of a safe zone. She said Sunday that she believes these zones could be carved out without foreign military intervention.
