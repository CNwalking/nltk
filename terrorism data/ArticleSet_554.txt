"America faces a different terrorist challenge than it did on Sept. 11, 2001, President Obama said Sunday at a ceremony honoring those who died at the Pentagon on 9/11.
Obama noted that the threat America faces has evolved since 9/11. After the United States delivered \"devastating blows to al-Qaeda\" and brought Osama bin Laden to justice, lone wolves prowl, attacking from \"Boston to San Bernardino to Orlando,\" he said.
At the Pentagon, where the terrorist attack killed 184 people Sept. 11, Obama was joined by Defense Secretary Ash Carter and Marine Gen. Joe Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Obama observed a moment of silence at the White House before he went to the Pentagon.
Obama addressed the survivors and the victims' families, saying, \"Your steadfast love and faithfulness has been an inspiration to me\" and the country. He praised \"patriots,\" both civilian and in the military, for \"defending not only our country but our ideals.\"
Honoring those who were killed in the 9/11 attacks and those who have served and died since is best done by standing together, he said.
\"We know that our diversity, our patchwork heritage, is not a weakness. It still, and always will be, one of our greatest strengths,\" Obama said.
Obama, making his final remarks on the anniversary of 9/11 as president, received a warm welcome from the audience on a warm, breezy morning. As he stepped on to the dais, one woman shouted, \"We love you!\"
He responded, \"Love you back.\"
Devora Kirschner, who lost her husband, Navy Lt. Darin Pontell, laid a flower on his bench at the Pentagon Memorial as her mother placed flowers on those of his seven shipmates who were killed.
She said they came to \"represent all the families because they are from far away.\" She worried about the nation's security but wanted to remember those who died.
\"My husband was a wonderful person, and everyone says that about him,\" Kirschner said. \"He was truly one of a kind.\"
Luticia Hook lost the fingers on her left hand and suffered second- and third-degree burns over nearly half her body after the jet slammed into the Pentagon. She was working on the building's first floor when the attack occurred.
Hook, surrounded by her husband, daughter and grandson, asked for prayers.
\"Just keep on praying for us,\" said Hook of Fort Washington, Md. \"Not only for me, those who lost a loved one, the children. Just keep on praying. Stop hating. Hating is no good.\"
She said she has no interest in suing Saudi Arabia, as a bill Congress approved last week would allow her to do. Saudi Arabia, a U.S. ally, denied a role in the attacks, although 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudis. Obama has vowed to veto the bill.
\"To me, I'm thankful that I'm here,\" Hook said. \"If I sue, what am I going to get? Money can't bring back my hand, money can't bring back the legs.\"
Despite her suffering, a smile never left her face Sunday.
\"Why shouldn't I be happy?\" she asked. \"I'm here. Fifteen years later, 15 years later.\"
Carter talked about hammering those who attack Americans and vowed to hunt them down.
\"Wherever they are, they will surely, no matter how long it takes, come to feel the righteous fist of American might,\" he said.
