"Tech companies Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and Google, owner of video service YouTube, agreed Tuesday to new rules from the European Union on how they manage hate speech infiltrating their networks.
The rules push companies to review requests to remove illegal online hate speech within 24 hours and respond accordingly, as well as raise awareness among users on what content is appropriate for their services.
In a joint statement from the European Commission and the companies involved, both sides say they recognize the \"collective responsibility\" to keep online spaces open for users to freely share their opinions.
In March, 32 people were killed in bombings at an airport and subway station in Brussels. The attacks and recent efforts by terrorist groups to recruit new members through social media including Facebook and YouTube prompted the new rule changes.
\"Social media is unfortunately one of the tools that terrorist groups use to radicalize young people and racists use to spread violence and hatred,\" said Vra Jourov, the EU's Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality.
