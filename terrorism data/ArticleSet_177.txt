"Kenyan forces pulled out of two towns in southern Somalia on Tuesday, and Islamist extremists moved into one of them, residents said. The withdrawal came after an attack by Shabab militants who claimed to have killed scores of Kenyan peacekeepers recently, residents said Tuesday. Some residents of the town of El-Adde, where the Jan. 15 attack happened, started returning to their homes, but residents of Badhadhe, another town in the Lower Jubba region, said Shabab militants took over and started searching homes. Kenyan officials have not said how many troops were killed in the El-Adde attack, but the Shabab claimed to have killed about 100 Kenyan soldiers. Kenya first sent troops to Somalia in 2011 to prevent extremists from crossing the border and carrying out attacks that threatened Kenya's crucial tourism sector.
