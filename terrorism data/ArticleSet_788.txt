"AMMAN, Jordan -- Jordanian security forces killed several Islamist militants during a manhunt on Tuesday that involved hundreds of troops in the northern city of Irbid, near the border with Syria, security officials said. A police officer was also killed during the operation.
Riot police officers and special forces took part in the operation, which a security official described as one of the largest sweeps against sleeper cells of sympathizers of hard-line Islamist groups in recent years.
Another security official said the troops and helicopters were deployed mainly in a Palestinian refugee camp in the heart of the city where most of the wanted fugitives were holed up.
Jordan did not confirm the identity of the targets, but said that the security forces had killed a number of \"fugitive outlaws\" and wounded several others. At least three members of the security forces were wounded.
Jordan has been host to United Nations camps for Palestinian refugees for decades. The squalid camps have long been fertile ground for militants.
Irbid, Jordan's second-largest city, also has one of the largest concentrations of Syrian refugees in the kingdom, which hosts more than 1.4 million people who have fled Syria's civil war.
Jordan has put on trial and sentenced dozens of militants who returned from Syria, some of whom were recruited by Syria's Al Qaeda offshoot, the Nusra Front, or the Islamic State group.
It has also arrested dozens of sympathizers who show support for the group on social media.
