"The widow of a man killed in last month's terror attack in San Bernardino, Calif., has filed four claims against the county and is seeking damages totaling $58 million. The claims were filed in late December on behalf of the widow, Renee Wetzel, whose 37-year-old husband, Michael Wetzel, was one of 14 people killed in the attack at the Inland Regional Center, The Sun of San Bernardino reported Tuesday. No other claims stemming from the shootings have been filed against San Bernardino County, a spokeswoman, Felisa Cardona, said. Michael Wetzel, of Lake Arrowhead, worked as a supervising environmental health specialist for the county. He was killed while attending a holiday luncheon and training session for the county health department. The suit says his death was preventable and caused by negligent, careless actions of the respondents. The two shooters, Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, were killed in a gun battle with the police.
