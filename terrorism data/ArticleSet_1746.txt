"Since he was captured on Monday, Ahmad Khan Rahami, the man accused of carrying out bombings last weekend in Manhattan and on the Jersey Shore, has been hospitalized in Newark, recovering from gunshot wounds he sustained in a confrontation with the police.
From his bed at University Hospital, he has been charged by three different prosecutors: the United States attorneys in Manhattan and New Jersey, for his alleged role in the bombings; and the Union County, N.J., prosecutor, for allegedly trying to kill police officers who tracked him down on Monday in the city of Linden. A New Jersey judge has ordered him held on $5.2 million bail on the state charges.
Yet despite the burst of legal proceedings and litany of charges made public this week, Mr. Rahami has not had a lawyer for almost the entire time he has been in custody, and even now, the question of his legal representation remains unsettled.
On Thursday, Peter A. Liguori, a state public defender in Union County, sought to meet with Mr. Rahami but was prevented by a lawyer with the Union County prosecutor's office, according to a filing Mr. Liguori submitted to a judge in Superior Court in Elizabeth, the county seat.
\"I attempted to meet with or at least see Mr. Rahami to confirm his condition,\" Mr. Liguori wrote to the judge, Regina Caulfield. But, he said, a prosecutor, Ann Luvera, told him that Mr. Rahami was \"unconscious and unable to speak,\" and she \"would not give me permission to visit.\"
Earlier in the week, Mr. Liguori had said that neither Mr. Rahami nor his family had sought representation from the public defender. But since then, Mr. Rahami's father had asked the office to represent his son, who had been found to be eligible as an indigent defendant, Mr. Liguori said
In the court filing, Mr. Liguori said he was formally entering his appearance in the case, the latest twist in a flurry of unusual activity to secure legal representation for Mr. Rahami.
Usually when people are arrested on federal or state charges, they are taken to court promptly, informed of their rights and, if they cannot afford a lawyer, appointed one. But the delay in providing Mr. Rahami a lawyer has raised concerns among legal rights advocacy groups as well as lawyers who have been seeking to represent him.
\"It is outrageous that the prosecutor is refusing to give permission to the public defender to visit Mr. Rahami,\" said Udi Ofer, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, which is not involved in the case. \"It is vital that the public defender be given access to his client so that Mr. Rahami's medical condition may be verified and his rights are protected.\"
A spokesman for the Union County prosecutor's office could not be reached for comment late Friday afternoon after the public defender's filing was released by a court official.
It could not be learned on Friday whether Judge Caulfield had acted on Mr. Liguori's request to represent Mr. Rahami. But much of the debate over the bombing suspect's legal representation has come amid great mystery about his medical condition.
Law enforcement officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the continuing investigation, have said that Mr. Rahami was shot multiple times. He remained intubated as of Thursday.
When was he taken to the hospital, a senior law enforcement official said, investigators questioned him briefly in the ambulance, asking for his name and whether he had any weapons, but gathered little useful information.
The official said Mr. Rahami was not questioned under the so-called public safety exception to the Miranda rules. Under the exception, investigators interrogate a suspect for intelligence purposes without advising the suspect of his rights, a tactic used in previous terrorism cases. A suspect is only then advised of his rights and questioned for law enforcement purposes.
David E. Patton, the chief federal public defender in New York City, where Mr. Rahami is expected to be prosecuted first on the federal charges, wrote to a judge in Manhattan on Tuesday, asking that Mr. Rahami be brought there \"at the earliest possible time\" for a court appearance. If he was unable to travel because of his medical condition, Mr. Patton said, the office could meet with him in the hospital and represent him via videoconference.
The office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, opposed the request, arguing that Mr. Rahami had not been arrested on federal charges and therefore the right to a speedy court appearance and to a lawyer had not been triggered. A magistrate judge, Gabriel W. Gorenstein, ruled for the government, agreeing that there had been no federal arrest.
On Wednesday, Richard Coughlin, the federal public defender for New Jersey, made a similar request in the United States District Court in Newark. The office of Paul J. Fishman, the United States attorney for New Jersey, opposed that request, and it was denied on Friday by a magistrate judge, Mark Falk.
Mr. Liguori, in his letter to Judge Caulfield, noted that but for Mr. Rahami's \"apparent incapacity, he was due to be produced before the court for his original appearance\" on Thursday.
\"Except for these extraordinary circumstances, I would have entered my appearance\" at that proceeding, he wrote.
Mr. Patton, the public defender in Manhattan, said the questions surrounding Mr. Rahami's representation were \"starting to look like a game of three-card monte.\"
\"I don't care where his lawyer comes from,\" he added. \"He just needs a lawyer.\"
