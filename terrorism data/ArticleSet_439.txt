"FBI Director James Comey said Monday there was no evidence to indicate Orlando mass shooter Omar Mateen was directed by an outside terror organization, nor was he part of an international terror network.
In his first public remarks since Sunday's massacre, the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, Comey said there were strong indications Mateen was radicalized over the Internet before he launched his attack on the crowded nightclub that left 49 victims dead and 53 wounded. The gunman died in a shootout with police.
Comey defended the FBI's reviews of Mateen's activities before the shooting, saying the gunman was the subject of a 10-month inquiry beginning in May 2013 after he made inflammatory remarks to colleagues at a Florida courthouse where he worked as an armed security guard.
Those remarks, Comey said, included a reference to a family connection with al-Qaeda and a desire to martyr himself should law enforcement seek to raid his Florida home.
The director said Mateen was subjected to a multifaceted inquiry conducted by the Miami FBI office. The inquiry reviewed Mateen's two trips to Saudi Arabia in 2011 and 2012, both of which revealed no improper contacts.
Agents interviewed Mateen twice during the probe, and he acknowledged making the provocative statements out of anger because of his co-workers' mistreatment of him and their ridicule of his Muslim faith. The investigation was closed in March 2014.
