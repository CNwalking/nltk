"GAZA CITY -- Israel struck at Hamas military bases in the Gaza Strip overnight, killing a 10-year-old boy and his 6-year-old sister, a Palestinian official said on Saturday. The airstrikes came after Palestinian militants fired rockets toward Israeli border communities late Friday.
One of the airstrikes targeted a Hamas base in northwestern Gaza, and shrapnel hit a nearby home, killing the boy, Yassin Abu Khoussa, as he slept and wounding two siblings, one seriously, said Ashraf al-Qidra, a spokesman for the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. One of the siblings, Yasmin, died in a hospital.
The family members were living in a prefabricated shelter beside their house, which was destroyed in the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas in the summer of 2014. Suleiman Abu Khoussa, 50, the children's father, said the family was sleeping when the missile struck nearby and the shelter began falling apart.
\"Their mother was screaming, 'The children are dead, the children are dead,' \" he said in a telephone interview. \"I went and I saw them covered in blood.\"
The last fatalities in Gaza from an Israeli airstrike in response to rocket fire occurred in October, when a pregnant Palestinian woman and a toddler were killed. But such deaths have been rare since a cease-fire ended the fighting in 2014, and the Gaza Strip had remained largely quiet.
No Palestinian militant groups claimed responsibility for the rocket fire toward Israel, which landed in open fields. Israel's defense minister, Moshe Yaalon, said later Saturday that a \"rogue group\" had fired the rockets but that Israel holds Hamas, the Islamist group that rules Gaza, responsible for all projectiles fired from the tiny coastal territory.
