"The last time the Senate held votes on gun legislation was December, a day after 14 people were killed in San Bernardino, Calif.
All four plans were defeated.
Before that, the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting that killed 20 children and six teachers inspired gun-control proposals in 2013. Those failed, too.
Now, after the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, Democrats are hoping for a breakthrough when the Senate holds four more votes Monday.
Republicans, too, are showing some movement, as they've proposed an amendment that would allow law enforcement to block a firearm sale for national security reasons in narrow circumstances.
The proposals scheduled for a vote Monday -- all as amendments to a Justice Department spending bill -- include:
An amendment by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., which would allow the attorney general to deny a gun sale to anyone if she has a \"reasonable belief\" -- a lesser standard than \"probable cause\" -- that the buyer was likely to engage in terrorism.
A Republican alternative by Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, which would require that law enforcement be alerted when anyone on the terrorist watch list attempts to buy a weapon from a licensed dealer. If the buyer has been investigated for terrorism within the past five years, the attorney general could block a sale for up to three days while a court reviews the sale.
An amendment by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, would make it more difficult to add mentally ill people to the background check database, giving those suspected of mental illness a process to challenge that.
An amendment by Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., that would close the \"gun show loophole\" by requiring every gun purchaser to undergo a background check and to expand the background check database.
