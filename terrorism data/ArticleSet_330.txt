"The man suspected of building bombs used in the Paris attacks last year was one of two suicide bombers who died in the Brussels airport attack, media outlets reported Wednesday.
The Associated Press, citing unnamed European authorities, reported that officials identified the bomber as Najim Laachraoui based on DNA samples from the airport blast. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to divulge details of the Belgian investigation.
The disclosure is the first evidence linking the deadly rampage in Paris that killed 130 in November to Tuesday's attacks in Brussels that left more than 30 dead.
Earlier Wednesday, prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw said Ibrahim El Bakraoui, 29, was the other airport suicide bomber and his brother, Khalid, 27, was the subway suicide bomber who detonated his device an hour later at a downtown station.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey deported Ibrahim last year because it suspected him of being a militant. He was deported to the Netherlands at his request after his native Belgium failed to establish a connection to terrorism, Erdogan said. Both nations were notified, he said.
In recent months, Khalid was the subject of an Interpol \"red notice,\" an international alert saying he was wanted on terrorism charges.
Video footage from the airport shows Ibrahim walking between two other men at Brussels Airport shortly before the fatal blasts.
The man on the left was the second suicide bomber, but authorities had not identified him. The reports of Laachraoui's identification would make him that bomber.
Police are still searching for the third man, who wore pale clothing and a hat and is suspected of leaving behind a 35-pound bomb that failed to detonate when he fled the airport.
