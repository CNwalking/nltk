"Iraq said Tuesday it is building a wall and trench around Baghdad in an effort to secure the city from terror attacks.
The Interior Ministry spokesman, Brig. Gen. Saad Maan, said work began this week on a 65-mile stretch of the wall and trench around the capital, the Associated Press reported. The wall will be 10 feet high and partially made up of concrete barriers, he said.
The Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIS, has seized large swaths of Iraq and neighboring Syria, but the terror group has not seized any territory in Baghdad. The group, however, has launched attacks inside the city using car or truck bombs.
The large defensive wall and trench will allow Iraqi authorities to dismantle many of the police checkpoints throughout the city, and free up security forces for use elsewhere in the battle against the Islamic State, the AP said.
Iraqi security forces backed by coalition airstrikes have made progress against the terror group throughout Iraq, coalition officials have said.
\"The enemy now controls about 40% less territory than it did at its zenith,\" said Lt. Gen. Sean MacFarland, commander of the U.S.-led coalition.
