COVID-19 battle is not a zero-sum game between countries


The New York Times Chinese published an article titled "What if the West loses in this epidemic?" The author, Deng Yuwen, discusses in the article whether the Western system will lose to the Chinese system when facing such a global public health emergency.

Many Western people have a similar mindset as the author. They are still sticking to the zero-sum mindset. When facing the COVID-19 pandemic, the common enemy of mankind, they are still arguing which country will lose and which will win. Some Western people have always regarded political systems as the crux.

But these people should understand that no matter what kind of political system a country adopts, the most important thing is to take the most advantage of its own system when facing the epidemic. This, of course, includes how to learn from other countries' effective prevention and control methods and jointly overcome the difficulties. Thus, this is not a question of which country wins the final competition, but a question of coexistence, common development and common victory over the enemy of all human beings.
