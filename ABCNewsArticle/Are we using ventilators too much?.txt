['Are we using ventilators too much?', None, None, '\nPatients with COVID-19 struggle to get sufficient levels of oxygen due to the severe lung damage caused by the virus, according to Dr. Scott Kopec, a pulmonology/critical care physician and former director of the pulmonary and critical care fellowship program at the University of Massachusetts. Kopec explained that lungs can be so severely compromised by COVID-19 that sometimes even a ventilator is not enough help.\n', None, '\nAlthough potentially lifesaving, ventilators come with their own set of inherent risks, including causing additional damage to the lungs. That poses a challenge to physicians.\n', '\nTo compensate for the severe lung damage in COVID-19, patients sometimes require high levels of oxygen and large amounts of air pressure to be supplied by the ventilator, Kopec said. But these extremely high levels of oxygen can do harm.', '\n"If you force too much pressure in, you can cause damage to the lungs," he said.\n', None, "\nThe ventilator's tube carrying air and extra oxygen to the lung can be an entry pathway for germs, which increases the risk of secondary lung infection, according to Jay Bhatt, DO, internal medicine physician and former chief medical officer of the American Hospital Association.", '\nAlthough ventilators pose challenges, physicians find themselves balancing the benefits with the risks so they can help critically ill patients who are no longer able to breathe safely on their own.\n', '\n"It\'s a careful balance of maintaining a minimum level of oxygenation with the possible side effects," said Dr. Katherine Fischkoff, surgeon and critical care physician at Columbia University.\n', '\nThese challenges have prompted some physicians and medical groups to publicly question the value of using ventilators early and often among patients with COVID-19.', '\nSo are we using ventilators too much? Right now, the answer is complicated.\n', '\nSome have argued that less invasive ways of supporting breathing may be just as good, and avoid the undesirable complications that come with using a ventilator.\n', None, None, "\nDespite the alternative ways to give a patient extra oxygen, experts agreed that when a patient's lungs start failing and oxygen gets critically low, ventilators are usually the best option available -- sometimes because they are the only option left.\n", '\n"Believe me, we don\'t want to use them, but I don\'t think that there are other good enough options at this time. We\'re using them as judiciously as we can," said Kopec.\n', '\nHe explained that some non-invasive options run a much higher risk of spreading the virus through tiny droplets in the air, particularly one called "bilevel positive airway pressure" or "BiPAP," which delivers oxygen through a face mask. Because of the increased risk it poses to health care workers, its use is minimized.\n', '\nDoctors can also help patients by just changing the position of their bodies. One strategy is called "prone positioning," which refers to lying a patient on their stomach to improve their breathing.\n', '\n"We are managing patients as best as possible with [non-invasive ventilation] ... we are also using prone positioning when feasible,"  said Dr. Subhash Krishnamoorthy, critical care physician at Columbia University. Ventilators are being used only "when all other available techniques have failed," Krishnamoorthy said.', None, None, None, '\nUltimately, using ventilators to help COVID-19 patients whose lungs fail boils down to two important things: using them thoughtfully, and using them correctly.\n', '\n"The critical care community tries to be really thoughtful about all the lessons that we\'ve learned and how to reduce injury," said Dr. Anthony Massaro, pulmonology/critical care physician and director of the medical intensive care unit at Brigham and Women\'s Hospital in Boston. "And all of that knowledge and expertise is put into considerations of the right way to use the ventilator."\n', None, '24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events']
